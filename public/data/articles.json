This is not just a technical success — it is the fulfillment of a moral obligation to the victims of mines and their families."

    "paragraph1": "Supabase, a popular developer database platform, is facing disruptions in India — one of its key markets — has been blocked in India, TechCrunch has learned. New Delhi ordered internet providers to block its website, resulting in patchy access across networks. The blocking order was issued on February 24 under Section 69A of India’s Information Technology Act, according to a source familiar with the matter.",
    "paragraph2": "The provision empowers the government to restrict public access to online content. The Indian government did not publicly cite a reason for the move, and it was not immediately clear whether the action was linked to a cybersecurity concern, copyright complaint, or another issue. It was also unclear how long the restrictions would remain in place. Access to Supabase has been inconsistent in India over the past several days, with the San Francisco-based company acknowledging the issue in posts on social media starting Wednesday.",
    "paragraph3": "While the restrictions were first reported by Supabase on Reliance Industries’ JioFiber network, users have since flagged similar problems across multiple internet providers and telecom networks. In one post on Friday, Supabase tagged India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, asking him to intervene and restore access, though the company later removed the message and said in a subsequent update that the site remained blocked for many users in the country. We understand many users in India continue to be blocked from accessing Supabase."

The employee used confidential OpenAI information in connection with the trades made, the company alleges. OpenAI didn’t release the name of the employee.",
    "paragraph2": "However, a spokesperson said that such actions violated a company policy that bans workers from using inside information for personal gain, including on prediction markets. Prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi allow people to make wagers on the outcomes of real-world events. For instance, on Polymarket, there are wagers being made around the kind of products OpenAI will announce in 2026 and when the company will go public. They can cover any event, and some eye-popping money can be made.",
    "paragraph3": "As we recently reported, an accountant won a $470,300 jackpot on Kalshi by betting against DOGE believers. Prediction markets insist they are not gambling sites, preferring to label themselves as financial platforms. Kalshi is a regulated exchange and, in fact, it fined and banned a MrBeast editor for similar alleged insider trading earlier this week."

    "paragraph1": "In a newly released deposition filed in Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, the tech executive attacked OpenAI’s safety record, claiming that his company, xAI, better prioritizes safety. He went so far as to say that “Nobody has committed suicide because of Grok, but apparently they have because of ChatGPT.” The comment came up in a line of questioning about a public letter Musk signed in March 2023.",
    "paragraph2": "In it, he called on AI labs to pause development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, OpenAI’s flagship model at the time, for at least six months. The letter, which was signed by over 1,100 people, including many AI experts, stated there was not enough planning and management taking place at AI labs, as they were locked in an “out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one — not even their creators — can understand, predict, or reliably control.” Those fears have since gained credibility. OpenAI now faces a series of lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT’s manipulative conversation tactics have led several people to experience negative mental health effects, with some dying by suicide.",
    "paragraph3": "Musk’s comment suggests that these incidents could be used as fodder in his case against OpenAI. The transcript of Musk’s video testimony, which took place back in September, was filed publicly this week, ahead of the expected jury trial next month. The lawsuit against OpenAI centers on the company’s shift from a nonprofit AI research lab to a for-profit company, which Musk claims violated its founding agreements."

As usage scales, the product improves in ways people feel immediately: faster responses, higher reliability, stronger safety, and more consistent performance.” The new weekly active user figure marks a jump of 100 million users from the 800 million that OpenAI reported in October 2025.

ASAP was particularly concerned about Artemis III, which its report said included too many “cumulative technical, operational, and schedule risks associated with multiple first-of-a-kind objectives planned for a single mission.”The Artemis II mission, scheduled for this year, has faced a string of issues during testing over recent weeks, delaying its launch until no earlier than April."

    "paragraph1": "Google and other browser makers require that all TLS certificates be published in public transparency logs, which are append-only distributed ledgers. Website owners can then check the logs in real time to ensure that no rogue certificates have been issued for the domains they use. The transparency programs were implemented in response to the 2011 hack of Netherlands-based DigiNotar, which allowed the minting of 500 counterfeit certificates for Google and other websites, some of which were used to spy on web users in Iran.",
    "paragraph2": "Once viable, Shor’s algorithm could be used to forge classical encryption signatures and break classical encryption public keys of the certificate logs. Ultimately, an attacker could forge signed certificate timestamps used to prove to a browser or operating system that a certificate has been registered when it hasn’t. To rule out this possibility, Google is adding cryptographic material from quantum-resistant algorithms such as ML-DSA. This addition would allow forgeries only if an attacker were to break both classical and post-quantum encryption.",
    "paragraph3": "The new regime is part of what Google is calling the quantum-resistant root store, which will complement the Chrome Root Store the company formed in 2022. The MTCs use Merkle Trees to provide quantum-resistant assurances that a certificate has been published without having to add most of the lengthy keys and hashes. Using other techniques to reduce the data sizes, the MTCs will be roughly the same 64-byte length they are now, Westerbaan said."

    "paragraph1": "Despite the headline, this isn’t really a story about superconductivity—at least not the superconductivity that people care about, the stuff that doesn’t require exotic refrigeration to work. Instead, it’s a story about how superconductivity can be used as a test of some of the weirder consequences of quantum mechanics, one that involves non-existent particles of light that still act as if they exist. Researchers have found a way to get these virtual photons to influence the behavior of a superconductor, ultimately making it worse.",
    "paragraph2": "That may, in the end, tell us something useful about superconductivity, but it’ll probably take a little while. Virtual reality The story starts with quantum field theory, which is incredibly complex, but the simplified version is that even empty space is filled with fields that could govern the interactions of any quantum objects in or near that space. You can think of different particles as energetic excitements of these fields—so a photon is simply an energetic state of the quantum field. Some of these particles have real existences we can track, like a photon emitted by a laser and absorbed by a detector some distance away.",
    "paragraph3": "But the quantum field also allows for virtual photons, which simply act to transmit the electromagnetic force between particles. We can’t really directly detect these, but we can definitely track their effects. One of the stranger consequences of this is that locations that have a strong electromagnetic field can be filled with virtual photons even when no real ones are present."

    "paragraph1": "an AI apocalypse Director Gore Verbinksi and screenwriter Matthew Robinson on the making of this darkly satirical sci-fi film. Credit: Briarcliff Entertainment We haven’t had a new film from Gore Verbinski for nine years. But the director who brought us the first three Pirates of the Caribbean movies, the nightmare-inducing horror of The Ring (2002), and the Oscar-winning hijinks of Rango (2011) is back in peak form with Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die.",
    "paragraph2": "It’s a darkly satirical, inventive, and hugely entertaining time-loop adventure that also serves as a cautionary tale about our widespread online technology addiction. (Some spoilers below but no major reveals.) Sam Rockwell stars as an otherwise unnamed man who shows up at a Norms diner in Los Angeles looking like a homeless person but claiming to be a time traveler from an apocalyptic future. He’s there to recruit the locals into his war against a rogue AI, although the diner patrons are understandably dubious about his sanity.",
    "paragraph3": "(“I come from a nightmare apocalypse,” he assures the crowd about his grubby appearance. “This is the height of f*@ing fashion!”) The fact that he knows everything about the people in the diner is more convincing."

    "paragraph1": "Dan Simmons, the author of more than three dozen books, including the famed Hyperion Cantos, has died from a stroke. He was 77. Simmons, who worked in elementary education before becoming an author in the 1980s, produced a broad portfolio of writing that spanned several genres, including horror fiction, historical fiction, and science fiction.",
    "paragraph2": "Often, his books included elements of all of these. This obituary will focus on what is generally considered his greatest work, and what I believe is possibly the greatest science fiction novel of all time, Hyperion. Published in 1989, Hyperion is set in a far-flung future in which human settlement spans hundreds of planets. The novel feels both familiar, in that its structure follows Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, and utterly unfamiliar in its strange, far-flung setting.",
    "paragraph3": "Seven characters, seven stories At its heart are the background stories of seven characters on a pilgrimage to the Time Tombs, which move backward in time. There, they may possibly confront a legendary, mythical, terrifying, and time-bending creature known as the Shrike. Each of the stories told by the seven characters is done so in a different subgenre, from tragedy to political thriller to military science fiction, and so on."

That’s why we tested some of the most popular instant cameras on the market from brands like Fujifilm, Polaroid, Leica, Canon, Kodak, and others.All the models featured in our instant camera buying guide are enjoyable to use, but each offers a distinct set of features at a different price point. As a result, some are more appropriate for a child or budding photographer, while others are more advanced and provide added creative control (for a price).",
    "paragraph3": "When it comes down to it, though, we consider print quality, ease of use, and affordability to be the hallmarks of a quality shooter. That’s why we picked Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 as the best instant camera for most people, as it ticks all three boxes wonderfully.Best overallBest premium pickBest for social occasionsBest for retro fansMost portableIf you’re looking for more creative control or features like filters, however, the Instax Mini Evo is our choice, one that offers great image quality and lets you choose which photos you’d like to print."

    "paragraph2": "Aditya Tiwari Neowin @TheLazyAvenger · Feb 27, 2026 13:44 EST It was four years ago that Apple launched the Studio Display monitor to work with Mac computers and select iPad models. Fast forward to now, the company is expected to launch its successor as early as next week, alongside a platter of new Apple products. The macOS 26.3 update from earlier this month referenced J427 and J527 codenames for Apple's monitor, suggesting there would be two versions of the Studio Display 2.",
    "paragraph3": "It's also known that the next-generation Studio Display will come fitted with 120Hz ProMotion and HDR. Macworld took the time to dig into Apple's system files and found that the two references are separate displays with differentiating features. While both J427 and J527 are expected to share the same core display capabilities, each monitor has a different audio driver, suggesting Apple might choose to include different speakers."

I don’t use high-impedance headphones, and I care about overall battery life more than fast charging. No True Tone display is fine since I usually turn that feature off everywhere anyway.",

The Mac SSD speed controversy a few years ago was more theoretical than anything to me, so I’m probably good in that department."

    "paragraph2": "If you’re a responsible smartphone user, chances are that your phone is already secured with a screen lock — and hopefully that involves a sufficiently long password or PIN. But there’s another PIN you could (and arguably, should) be using to keep your accounts and communication safe: a SIM PIN. And now with Android 17 Beta 2 available to Pixel testers, we’ve spotted a new change Google appears to be working on to make SIM PINs much, much more convenient.Let’s start by clearing up what we’re talking about here, as there’s a fair chance that you’ve never even heard of a SIM PIN before now, and have no idea what’s going on.",
    "paragraph3": "Just like a PIN code can keep your phone safe by requiring its entry when your device starts up, a SIM PIN does the same for securing access to your cellular account. When you a power on a phone with a PIN-locked SIM, it won’t be able to make calls, work with texts, or use data until the PIN is entered.Hopefully, you can already see how this could be handy."

    "paragraph2": "The results are nothing short of astonishing, with Panther Lake delivering up to 95X higher performance than Penryn in specific workloads.Go deeper with TH Premium: CPUIt's fascinating to think that dual-core designs were the standard back then. Over time, configurations expanded to quad-core designs, and recent generations of mobile Intel processors feature up to 16 cores. The leap in core counts benefited significantly from Intel's shift to a hybrid architecture that combines performance and efficiency cores.",

Apple CEO Tim Cook teased a \"big week ahead\" with an \"Apple Launch\" hashtag, plus Apple has media events scheduled in New York, Shanghai, and London on Wednesday, March 4. We're expecting the iPhone 17e, an all-new low-cost MacBook, and minor refreshes to the Mac and iPad lines.",
    "paragraph2": "Low-Cost MacBook Rumors about the MacBook's design make it sound a lot like the MacBook Air. It will have an aluminum chassis in a range of colors, and a 12.9-inch or 13-inch display, depending on the rumor. It's possible the low-cost MacBook will have a thin and light design because it's going to use a lower power A-series chip that doesn't require a lot of heat dissipation, but that's not yet confirmed.",
    "paragraph3": "Apple used to have a 12-inch MacBook with a thin design and a low-power Core M chip, and it's been suggested that this new MacBook could be something of a revival of that machine. Thinner and lighter typically means more expensive with Apple products, so a super slim design might not be what Apple is optimizing for. Making the low-cost MacBook thinner than the ‌MacBook Air‌ could just confuse the MacBook lineup."

Now, amid rumors pointing to an OLED display for the next generation, could the ‌iPad mini‌ finally replace devices such as the Kindle and Kobo? The shift from LCD to OLED could make the ‌iPad mini‌ far more appealing as a reading device.",
    "paragraph2": "OLED panels allow each pixel to turn off individually, producing true blacks and extremely high contrast. Text can appear sharper and more defined against a dark background, particularly in dark mode. Night reading is also typically more comfortable because the display can emit less light overall. Color reproduction and viewing angles also improve with OLED, which could make a big difference for comics, magazines, and illustrated books.",
    "paragraph3": "Another benefit is power efficiency. OLED displays can consume less energy when displaying dark content. That could modestly extend battery life during reading sessions."

In a blog post, Supertails said that the fire started at a perfume warehouse located in the same facility as its own warehouse. As the fire spread, it engulfed three warehouses, including the one owned by Supertails.",
    "paragraph2": "The startup said that all its employees working at the warehouse were completely safe. The incident took place on February 22 in the middle of Supertails’ flagship WTF Sale. Due to the uncertainty, the startup decided to cancel the sale a day after it recorded “the highest ever revenue in its five-year journey”. The Bengaluru-based startup said it has already secured another primary warehouse in the city and turned it fully operational and ready to fulfill orders.",
    "paragraph3": "It added that less than 1% orders placed during the sale were cancelled due to the incident, and new dates for a fresh sale will be announced soon. The incident took place weeks after Supertails secured $30 Mn in its Series C round that saw investors like Titan Capital and Nippon India joining its cap table. The startup has raised over $57 Mn to date from investors like RPSG Capital Ventures, Fireside Ventures, Saama Capital, DSG Consumer Partners and Sauce."

    "paragraph1": "“When nuclear energy has been successfully applied for power production, in say a couple of decades from now, India will not have to look abroad for its experts but will find them ready at hand.” — Homi J. Bhabha, in a letter to the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, March 1944 A Historic Revival — And A Long Pending One Bhabha wrote those words before India was even an independent nation.",
    "paragraph2": "Eight decades later, the country he helped shape as a nuclear pioneer has finally done something it resisted for over six decades: it has opened the civil nuclear energy sector to private enterprise. The Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill, passed by both Houses of Parliament and granted Presidential assent in December 2025, repeals the Atomic Energy Act of 1962 and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act of 2010 in a single stroke. For the first time since Independence, private Indian companies can build, own, operate, and decommission nuclear power plants. The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board has been granted statutory independence.",
    "paragraph3": "Liability has been restructured to align, at least partially, with international conventions. The verdict from industry has been enthusiastic, and understandably so. Holtec International has announced plans to deploy up to 200 small modular reactors in India through its subsidiary."

Following a stellar Q3 FY26, many of these startups are reporting soaring profits and robust occupancy, shedding their disruptor image to become more stable, disciplined operators. So, what’s their secret sauce?",
    "paragraph2": "The Q3 Turnaround: The December 2026 quarter provided a definitive answer to investors worried about the coworking industry’s lease-heavy model. While WeWork India and Smartworks swung back in the black, Awfis reported a 43% YoY surge in profits. This across-the-board profitable performance signals that the industry has reached an inflexion point, where scale, operational leverage and high occupancy are finally translating into a durable bottom line. The Enterprise Moat: As per industry insiders, coworking is no longer a haven for startups, but a strategic tool for the Fortune 500.",
    "paragraph3": "While large enterprises contributed 75% of WeWork India’s revenue in Q3, the number stood at 90% for rival Smartworks. With average enterprise lock-ins stretching beyond 30 months, these coworking giants have now replaced “churn-heavy” freelancers with structurally sticky corporate cash flows. Operational Maturity: The sector is demonstrating a newfound financial discipline."

    "paragraph1": "The post-listing financial performance of some of India’s leading coworking firms is beginning to address the concerns that investors had ahead of their IPOs. The strong Q3 show of WeWork India, Awfis, Smartworks points to improving occupancy, rising enterprise demand and sharper capital discipline. This also shows that the sector is moving towards cash generation and portfolio optimisation.",
    "paragraph2": "With large corporate clients driving a bigger share of revenue, mature centres have begun to generate stronger margins. Flexible workspace companies are slowly moving away from being seen as startup-focused disruptors to becoming more stable, disciplined operators in India’s office market. India’s listed coworking players are beginning to draw a sharper line between pre-IPO scepticism and post-listing performance, and WeWork India is a prime example. Ahead of its market debut, concerns shrouded its 100% OFS public listing that brought no fresh capital into the business, its negative net worth despite restated profitability, and a lease-heavy model concentrated largely in Bengaluru and Mumbai.",
    "paragraph3": "Retail investors were unsure whether the company could continue growing without taking on more financial pressure, weakening its balance sheet further. Coworking Companies Find Their Footing Months after listing on October 10, 2025, WeWork India has flipped the script. It reported a second consecutive profitable quarter in Q3 FY26, posting a consolidated PAT of ₹16."

Modelled after the defence ministry’s innovations for defence excellence (iDEX) initiative, the Rail Tech policy aims to engage innovators, startups and other institutions to build solutions for the ministry. As part of this, Vaishnaw launched a new “Rail Tech portal”, where startups can propose solutions directly to the Railways.",

Under the initiative, the ministry will offer up to 50% of the funding once the project is approved. Post the “successful” development of the solution, the Railways said that it will place “substantial long-term orders” for the innovation. The minister said that the objective of the policy is to create a simplified framework focussed on adoption of new technologies, rather than the earlier system of vendor selection based strictly on rigid specifications.",

Vaishnaw also urged startups to develop use cases such as AI-based elephant intrusion detection system, predictive AI-based fire detection system in coaches, rail stress monitoring system, AI-based coach cleaning and monitoring system, track monitoring tools, among others."

    "paragraph1": "New Delhi, Feb 27 (PTI) Broadband India Forum, an industry body that represents major tech firms like Meta, Google, and others, has questioned the legal validity of the government's SIM binding mandate, citing a senior counsel's opinion that termed the direction as \"ultra vires the parent legislation\" and \"unconstitutional\".In a letter dated February 23 to the Department of Telecom (DoT) secretary Amit Agrawal, BIF highlighted the legal opinion which concluded that the Telecommunications (Telecom Cyber Security) Amendment Rules, 2025, and recent directives regarding 'SIM binding' exceed the authority granted by the parent Telecommunications Act of 2023.The matter pertains to a direction issued by the central government in November that will ensure app-based communication services, the likes of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, and others, are continuously linked to a user's active SIM card.",
    "paragraph2": "In fact, Union Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, earlier this week, in a briefing, made it clear that the decision on SIM-binding rules will not change. There are some issues that are national security issues, and on national security issues, there can be no compromise, the minister asserted.BIF, in its letter to DoT, said: \"We respectfully submit that while the intended objective of these amended rules and respective directions is well understood and appreciated, any such regulatory intervention must adhere to the principles of due process and proportionality and must be within the statutory ambit of the governing legislation, that is, The Telecommunication Act, 2023.\"The industry body said that the legal opinion provided to it by a senior counsel has concluded that the amendment rules and the consequential directions are \"ultra vires the parent legislation and are also unconstitutional\".",
    "paragraph3": "It further said that as per the legal opinion, by introducing and regulating Telecommunication Identifier User Entity or TIUE, which are non-authorised entities, the Amendment Rules materially alter the class of persons subject to telecom regulation and extend the statutory scope of the Act, by way of delegated legislation (Amendment Rules).\"In particular, permitting TIUEs to 'use' telecommunication identifiers misinterprets the objective of the Act, which confines lawful allocation and use of such identifiers to authorised entities only,\" it said.According to the opinion, the amendment rules and the consequential directions also create regulatory convergence without statutory harmonisation, BIF said."

    "paragraph2": "12 billion units, the research firm said in a report.The decline will hit low-end Android manufacturers the hardest, while Apple and Samsung are positioned to gain market share as smaller rivals struggle or exit the market entirely, the report said.\"What we are witnessing is not a temporary squeeze, but a tsunami-like shock originating in the memory supply chain,\" said Francisco Jeronimo, vice president for Worldwide Client Devices at IDC.Analysts have said rising component costs will erode margins at smartphone companies focused on budget devices, forcing them to pass on the expenses to consumers at a time when demand at higher price points is weakening.",
    "paragraph3": "Apple and Samsung, with stronger balance sheets and premium positioning, are better equipped to weather the crisis, IDC said.The average selling price of smartphones is projected to surge 14% to a record $523 this year, as manufacturers shift toward higher-margin models to offset ballooning costs.IDC expects a modest 2% recovery in 2027 as the crisis eases, followed by a 5."

Crypto trader Darky noted that the market is roughly 140 days into the current bear cycle, projecting further downside. “We are going much lower, just a matter of time,” Darky said. CryptoQuant highlighted that historical post-halving bottoms often form between June and December, with the most likely window around September–November 2026.",
    "paragraph3": "Fellow analyst Batman confirmed: “Adding 365–396 days to the October 2025 all-time high puts the BTC cycle bottom around October–November 2026. Whatever price we get by then, it’s a no-brainer buy.” Bitcoin’s “supply in profit” has fallen to levels last seen in the 2022 bear market, suggesting a potential -70% to -75% drawdown."

The city has begun marking and reserving separate lanes for motorcyclists and cyclists, marking the first structured implementation of such infrastructure in Faisalabad’s history. Although the Faisalabad Development Authority proposed separate bike lanes in a 1978 structure plan, the initiative was never implemented, and subsequent urban planning frameworks did not carry the proposal forward.",
    "paragraph2": "Muhammad Asghar, a retired chief engineer of the Faisalabad Development Authority, noted that the Metropolitan Corporation and Highway Department are designing the lanes according to international standards. He explained that global guidelines recommend a minimum width of 1.5 meters for one-way lanes and 3.5 meters for two-way lanes.",
    "paragraph3": "Cycle lanes must remain clearly marked with solid white lines and reserved strictly for cyclists. Traffic staff may also be deployed on major roads to ensure compliance. Khalid Mahmood, a retired Metropolitan Corporation engineer, praised the initiative, emphasizing that previous urban planning overlooked the needs of millions who rely on motorcycles and bicycles for daily commuting."

Just three months ago, Suno announced a $250 million funding round that valued the company at $2.45 billion.",
    "paragraph2": "At the time, Suno told The Wall Street Journal that annual revenue had hit $200 million — that would indicate that the company has had some major growth in a short time frame. Suno lets users create music using natural language prompts, making it possible for people with little experience to generate audio with little effort. This has sparked concern from musicians and record labels, who have sued Suno for copyright infringement, since its AI model was likely trained on existing recorded music. But Warner Music Group recently settled its lawsuit and instead reached a deal that allows Suno to launch models that use licensed music from its catalog.",
    "paragraph3": "Suno has generated synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her poetry into the viral R&B song “How Was I Supposed to Know” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth $3 million. Still, many musicians have spoken out against the use of AI in music, including Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Katy Perry, and more."

Opening a vauable skin like this in a loot box is akin to winning a lottery, New York alleges in a new lawsuit. Credit: Twitter / Luksusbums For years now, Valve fans have been making jokes about the company’s slow transition from game maker to glorified digital hat and knife paint marketplace.",
    "paragraph2": "This week, though, a lawsuit brought by the state of New York argues that Valve’s in-game loot box sales amount to an illegal gambling outfit worth tens of billions of dollars. Lawyers who have looked into the particulars of the case tell Ars that the state faces an uphill battle in convincing courts that this portion of Valve’s business legally constitutes gambling. That said, there are a few elements of the case that might make Valve legally vulnerable to the state’s arguments. What is gambling, anyway?",
    "paragraph3": "For a game to legally be counted as “gambling” in most jurisdictions, it has to pass a three-part test: a player has to pay money (1) for an outcome that’s materially determined by chance (2) in the hopes of receiving something of value (3). While buying a key to a loot box in a Valve game easily passes those first two tests, New York’s legal case will likely hinge on whether the random cosmetic items players get from those loot boxes constitute “something of value” for statutory purposes. Even though loot box purchasers don’t know what item they’ll get, the fact that they know they’re getting something for their money could matter legally."

Paul Hill Neowin @ziks_99 · Feb 27, 2026 11:04 EST In its lifetime, Spotify already turned the music industry upside down and captured around a quarter of podcast market share. In 2023, the company broke into audiobooks, a natural niche for this company. Today, Spotify has decided to launch weekly charts for audiobooks where it will apply its playlist and algorithm playbook to the publishing industry.",
    "paragraph3": "With these charts, the audio streaming company wants to challenge traditional bestseller lists with a real-time data loop that it fully controls. By controlling these charts, it will put Spotify in a very strong position where it can pick winners and losers and essentially force authors and publishers to optimize their content for its platform’s engagement metrics as musicians have been forced to do for the last 15 years. The audiobook charts are powered by your listening behavior and engagement rather than unit sales."

The deal is an expansion of their previous $38 billion deal, and makes Amazon Web Services the exclusive third-party cloud distributor for OpenAI's new enterprise platform, Frontier. Amazon is kicking off the partnership with an initial $15 billion investment, with the remaining $35 billion to follow once certain conditions are met. In return, OpenAI is committing $100 billion to Amazon Web Services over the next eight years to secure cloud infrastructure and custom silicon.",
    "paragraph3": "This is not a typo; Amazon will first give $50 billion to OpenAI, and then OpenAI will legally be required to spend $100 billion on Amazon Web Services. It’s a classic merry-go-round deal where Big Tech is essentially exchanging money among itself, a phenomenon known as circular investing. As a part of this massive commitment, OpenAI will consume roughly two gigawatts of Amazon's custom Trainium compute capacity."

Team Green has been making more money than ever before and the latest earnings report from the company shows that it is still going strong despite worries of the AI “bubble” bursting at any time. And it is not just AI though, as the earnings shows that Nvidia has made plenty of money in its gaming division too. What is interesting is that the company's revenue shot up a massive 47% compared to last year despite actual sales being down 13% as opposed to the previous quarter.",
    "paragraph3": "This clearly shows that Nvidia is reaping the benefits of the overpriced market conditions that users are currently facing. This was confirmed during the earnings call by Nvidia's CFO Colette Kress who stated: \"Gaming revenue for the fourth quarter was up 47% from a year ago, driven by strong Blackwell demand. Gaming revenue was down 13% sequentially as channel inventory naturally moderated following a season of strong holiday demand.\""

This report is commissioned by one of the UK’s biggest communities of female founders, in partnership with Barclays. The detailed research is one of largest grassroots studies of its kind.",
    "paragraph2": "The findings captured the detailed views, stories and experiences of 2,225 UK-based female founders – who collectively generate £1 billion in annual turnover – and recorded 436,000 words of qualitative data. What's most compelling is that entrepreneurship, far from being a solo endeavour, thrives through community, peer support and shared experience. The new insights come alongside recent reports that the UK could unlock up to £310 billion in economic growth if women started and scaled businesses at the same rate as men. Connection at the core of the female founder journey The report reveals that the need for human connection runs deep across the female entrepreneurial community, regardless of the size or stage of business: 78 per cent of respondents cited human connection as central to their entrepreneurial journey.",
    "paragraph3": "Peer networks were identified as the most effective form of support, cited by 39 per cent of respondents. Mentorship and coaching were stated by 32 per cent as vital forms of support. However, when connection breaks down, the consequences are significant."

The round was led by Join Capital, with participation from High-Tech Gründerfonds (HTGF), Faber, First Momentum Ventures, Lightfield Equity, Final Frontier Liftoff, the German Aerospace Center (DLR), and Start-up BW Seed Fonds, among others.",
    "paragraph2": "As satellite constellations grow denser and missions become more complex, spacecraft must reliably change orbits and avoid collisions with minimal margin for error. Existing propulsion solutions often lack the agility, responsiveness, and thrust required for these demands. At the same time, regulatory pressure is accelerating the phase-out of conventional systems that rely on highly toxic propellants such as hydrazine, prompting satellite manufacturers to reassess propulsion choices and seek safer alternatives. ISPTech is positioning its technology to address these trends.",
    "paragraph3": "The company is developing spaceflight-ready propulsion systems and expanding commercial engagement with satellite manufacturers and mission operators, with potential applications also spanning defence, in-orbit servicing, and refuelling. Dr. Lukas Werling, CEO and co-founder of ISPTech, said that although reusable rockets have improved access to space, future growth will depend on improved in-orbit mobility."

    "paragraph1": "Dash0, an AI-native platform that helps companies monitor their cloud systems, is seeking investment for a funding round that would value the company at $1bn, according to reports. Founded in 2023, Dash0 originally launched in Germany but has since moved its headquarters to New York. The company retains a strong operational presence in Berlin and elsewhere in Europe.",
    "paragraph2": "Dash0’s platform helps developers and engineers monitor and troubleshoot problems in the cloud. The company offers an AI agent, Agent0, which acts as a copilot, helping users find the root cause of issues faster.In October, Dash0 announced it had raised a $35m Series A funding round, backed by Accel, Cherry Ventures and Dig Ventures. On Friday, Bloomberg reported the company was in talks with London-based Balderton Capital to lead a fresh round of funding, which would value Dash0 at $1bn, making it the latest European startup to achieve unicorn status.",
    "paragraph3": "Founder and CEO Mirko Novakovic previously told Sifted it was unclear how many European investors would contribute to future fundraises, saying he had taken investment from Cherry Ventures in part to increase the region’s representation on the company’s cap table. “There are not so many European funds who can do A, B, C at some stages. So I said ‘Probably this A round is the last chance for me to get a German or European VC in,’” he said."

    "paragraph2": "We’re releasing the third version of our Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP), the voluntary framework we use to mitigate catastrophic risks from AI systems,\" Anthropic said on Tuesday, marking the change. Anthropic's new safety policy: What changes?In a statement to Business Insider, the company also said that amid heightened competition and lack of government regulation, it would no longer abide by its commitment \"to pause the scaling and/or delay the deployment of new models\" when such advancements would have outpaced its own safety measures.Anthropic’s previous safety policy required it to pause training more powerful models if their capabilities outpaced the company’s ability to control them and ensure their safety — a measure that’s been removed in the new policy.",
    "paragraph3": "Explaining the shift, Anthropic said that the current policy environment with regard to the technology had \"shifted toward prioritizing AI competitiveness and economic growth, while safety-oriented discussions have yet to gain meaningful traction at the federal level.\"Further, the company's chief science officer, Jared Kaplan, told Time Magazine that its responsible scaling policy had failed to keep pace with the AI race. \"We felt that it wouldn't actually help anyone for us to stop training AI models."

    "paragraph2": "But recent fears about the disruptive potential of artificial intelligence have battered stock prices and investor sentiment so much that a reality check is warranted.The widespread AI euphoria that swept over Wall Street for much of the last year was probably unjustified, but so too is the fear that has gripped investors recently, sending the U.S. software services sector down 20% in less than a month.",
    "paragraph3": "These anxieties have been stoked by a series of viral long-form blog posts touting apocalyptic AI scenarios: millions of office jobs lost, spending power vanishes, demand is destroyed, the economy plunges into a deflationary tailspin, and stocks crash.The latest wave of worry was triggered by a 7,000-word piece, \"The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis,\" published by analysts at research firm Citrini on Sunday. The original post on X has been viewed nearly 10 million times."

    "paragraph2": "Russian media outlets had begun circulating unconfirmed reports earlier in the day that a criminal investigation had been opened against Durov by Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB.It comes two weeks after Russia’s communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, said it was restricting the Telegram app, accusing the company of refusing to abide by Russian law.The move triggered a rare wave of public outcry, including widespread criticism from pro-Kremlin military bloggers, who warned that Telegram was widely used by Russian troops fighting in Ukraine and restricting its service would derail military communications.However, Russian officials have continued to portray Telegram as a security risk.",
    "paragraph3": "Digital development minister Maksud Shadayev told Russian news wire Interfax that foreign intelligence agencies could be reading messages sent through Telegram by Russian soldiers on the front line.When asked about the case, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that the FSB had gathered information on a “large number of violations” by Telegram, as well as content that could “potentially pose a danger to our country.” He said Telegram had been unwilling to cooperate with the authorities."

    "paragraph1": "London, Feb 24 (PTI) AI could soon better understand people's accent and dialect, thanks to a landmark study being led by the University of Sheffield. The study, led by Dr Chris Montgomery from the University's School of English in collaboration with ICS.AI, the UK's fastest-growing, profitable AI business, is set to tackle one of the biggest challenges in public sector AI – how well digital services understand people who speak with different regional accents and dialects.",
    "paragraph2": "The collaboration is the first UK academic-industry partnership to apply sociolinguistic research to the evaluation of public sector conversational AI, focusing on how systems perform in real service interactions between citizens and public bodies - for example, when people contact their local council and conversational AI is used to answer questions and help them access the right information or services. The study is based on Dr Montgomery's systematic review of more than five decades of peer-reviewed research on accent and dialect variation across Great Britain.This follows a recent survey, which revealed that over half (52 per cent) of UK residents are concerned that AI may struggle to understand accents or dialects. This increases to 57 per cent in Wales, 67 per cent in Northern Ireland and 71 per cent in Scotland.",
    "paragraph3": "A Literature Review, which started ICS.AI's collaboration with the University of Sheffield in December 2025, found that misunderstanding and bias are most likely to arise not because of how people speak, but because of how speech is interpreted.While most existing studies focus on speech patterns, far less research examines how listeners recognise and judge accents and dialects in practice."

    "paragraph1": "The dust had barely settled on the India AI Impact Summit when OpenAI showed off its war chest this week. The $110 Bn fundraise is the largest private investment deal ever and takes OpenAI to a valuation of $730 Bn, just shy of the trillion-dollar mark. Amid all the concerns about the enormity and the scale of the AI challenge in front of India, this single deal serves as a signal that things are about to change even more rapidly than they have thus far.",
    "paragraph2": "This AI war chest, filled by Amazon, SoftBank, and Nvidia, gives OpenAI and Sam Altman all the ammunition to fight off Anthropic, which has emerged as its biggest challenger in recent months. Anthropic and Claude have completely turned the AI narrative around, and while many dismissed OpenAI as just a chatbot in the past, the SaaSpocalypse set off by Claude Work is clear for all to see. And it’s in this context that OpenAI’s fundraising seems pivotal and more than just incidental. The Asymmetry Of Power It is this financial asymmetry and the pace of disruption that should concern Indian companies — startups, IT giants and unicorns.",
    "paragraph3": "Particularly, given the announcements made by Anthropic and OpenAI in recent months for the Indian market. India joined Pax Silica and looked to play a bigger role in the AI supply chain and deepen engagement on critical technologies and supply chain resilience. It’s a way to secure the AI future of the country.",

The February decline came as Xiaomi’s broader electric vehicle division reported strong cumulative sales, delivering more than 500,000 units in just over 600 days, faster than Tesla reached a comparable milestone. Xiaomi has also been actively expanding its EV presence globally, unveiling new concepts such as the Vision GT supercar ahead of industry events and signalling broader ambitions beyond China’s domestic market. In China, the company has formed a safety advisory committee in response to recent accidents involving its SU7 vehicles and plans regular engagement with car owners, experts and media to improve safety performance.",

    "paragraph2": "The administration emphasized that any calls for protests or rallies will be dealt with strictly, signaling zero tolerance for violations. This comes shortly after a ban on flying drones, phantoms, and camcopters in Islamabad, which was announced on February 27, 2026. The District Magistrate of Islamabad issued a notification under Section 144, prohibiting the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) without prior official permission in both Islamabad and Rawalpindi. The notification clarified that only law enforcement agencies and the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration are exempted from the ban.",
    "paragraph3": "All private individuals or entities are required to obtain authorization before operating drones or similar aerial devices. Authorities stressed that the measures are being enforced to maintain law and order in the federal capital.",

Prescribing a specific workflow to consumers assumes that everyone is the same, and this simply isn’t true. We all have different needs, expectations, and methods for completing a task effectively. It’s important that you understand my point of view, as it’s not the functionality that Spotify’s shortcut gestures provide that alienates me, but rather the forced implementation of them.",
    "paragraph3": "Do you want Spotify to give you more control over the app's gestures?21 votesIf you’re not a Spotify user, you’ll likely need some additional context — just know that the app offers so many shortcut swipes, taps, and long-presses for playback and queue management. You can swipe right to add songs to the queue, which is supremely useful when actively managing a session.",

    "paragraph1": "One day not long ago, a founder texted his investor with an update: he was replacing his entire customer service team with Claude Code, an AI tool that can write and deploy software on its own. To Lex Zhao, an investor at One Way Ventures, the message indicated something bigger — the moment when companies like Salesforce stopped being the automatic default. “The barriers to entry for creating software are so low now thanks to coding agents, that the build versus buy decision is shifting toward build in so many cases,” Zhao told TechCrunch.",

On top of that, customers now have the ultimate contract negotiation tool in their pockets: If they don’t like a SaaS vendor’s prices, they can, more easily than ever before, build their own alternative.",

For another, Netflix’s commitment to the deal reportedly wavered after Paramount came in with an increased offer and seemed willing to go several more rounds in a bidding war.

    "paragraph1": "Anthropic’s chatbot Claude seems to have benefited from the attention around the company’s fraught negotiations with the Pentagon. As first reported by CNBC, as of Saturday afternoon, Claude is currently ranked number two among free apps in Apple’s US App Store — the number one app is OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and number three is Google Gemini. According to data from SensorTower, Claude was just outside the top 100 at the end of January, and has spent most of February somewhere in the top 20.",
    "paragraph2": "Its ranking has climbed in the last few days, from sixth on Wednesday to fourth on Thursday to second on Saturday (today). After Anthropic attempted to negotiate for safeguards preventing the Department of Defense from using its AI models for mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons, President Donald Trump directed federal agencies to stop using all Anthropic products and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said he’s designating the company a supply-chain threat. OpenAI subsequently announced its own agreement with the Pentagon, which CEO Sam Altman claimed includes safeguards related to domestic surveillance and autonomous weapons.",

    "paragraph1": "It takes a lot of computing power to run an AI product — and as the tech industry races to tap the power of AI models, there’s a parallel race underway to build the infrastructure that will power them. On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade — with much of that money coming from AI companies. Along the way, they’re placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industry’s building capacity to its limit.",
    "paragraph2": "Below, we’ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We’ll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher. Microsoft’s 2019 investment in OpenAI This is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom: In 2019, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI — and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft’s investment started to come in the form of Azure cloud credit rather than cash.",
    "paragraph3": "It was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion — a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company. The partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently.",

Still, I’ve had a sample of the phone for a few weeks, so its big claims aren’t all hypothetical.Last year Google proved its hardware chops with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, the first foldable with an IP68 rating, meaning the maximum rating for dust protection and a near-top rating for water.

Credit: DeAgostini/Getty Images In 1774, British physician-scientist Charles Blagden received an unusual invitation from a fellow physician: to spend time in a small room that was hotter, he wrote, “than it was formerly thought any living creature could bear.” Many people may have been appalled by this offer, but Blagden was delighted by the opportunity for self-experimentation.",

Today, this ability to maintain a stable body temperature—called homeothermy—is known to exist among myriad species of mammals and birds. But there are also some notable exceptions. The body temperature of the fat-tailed dwarf lemur, for example, can fluctuate by nearly 45°F (25°C) over a single day.",
    "paragraph3": "In fact, a growing body of research suggests that many more animals than scientists once appreciated employ this flexible approach—heterothermy—varying their body temperature for minutes, hours, or weeks at a time. This may help the animals to persist through all sorts of dangers. “Because we’re homeotherms, we assume all mammals work the way we do,” says Danielle Levesque, a mammalian ecophysiologist at the University of Maine.",

    "paragraph1": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced late on Friday that his company has reached an agreement allowing the Department of Defense to use its AI models in the department’s classified network. This follows a high-profile standoff between the DoD — also known under the Trump administration as the Department of War — and OpenAI’s rival Anthropic. The Pentagon pushed AI companies, including Anthropic, to allow their models to be used for “all lawful purposes,” while Anthropic sought to draw a red line around mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons.",
    "paragraph2": "In a lengthy statement released Thursday, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said the company “never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an ad hoc manner,” but he argued that “in a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values.” More than 60 OpenAI employees and 300 Google employees signed an open letter this week asking their employers to support Anthropic’s position. After Anthropic and the Pentagon failed to reach an agreement, President Donald Trump criticized the “Leftwing nut jobs at Anthropic” in a social media post that also directed federal agencies to stop using the company’s products after a six-month phase-out period. In a separate post, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth claimed Anthropic was trying to “seize veto power over the operational decisions of the United States military.",
    "paragraph3": "” Hegseth also said he is designating Anthropic as a supply-chain risk: “Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic.” On Friday, Anthropic said it had “not yet received direct communication from the Department of War or the White House on the status of our negotiations,” but insisted it would “challenge any supply chain risk designation in court.” Techcrunch event San Francisco, CA | October 13-15, 2026 Surprisingly, Altman claimed in a post on X that OpenAI’s new defense contract includes protections addressing the same issues that became a flashpoint for Anthropic.",

Now, rapid advances in multimodal AI are accelerating so-called embodied AI — autonomous machines operating in the real world — a push officials say could help offset labor shortages and drive productivity gains.",
    "paragraph2": "At this early stage of humanoid robot development, Chinese companies are outpacing their U.S. rivals in both speed and volume, Selina Xu, a China and AI policy lead at the office of Eric Schmidt said. “China has a more robust hardware supply chain — much of it built up through the EV sector, from sensors to batteries — and the world’s strongest manufacturing base, allowing companies to iterate far faster than Western competitors,” Xu told TechCrunch.",

New Delhi ordered internet providers to block its website, resulting in patchy access across networks. The blocking order was issued on February 24 under Section 69A of India’s Information Technology Act, according to a source familiar with the matter.",
    "paragraph2": "The provision empowers the government to restrict public access to online content. The Indian government did not publicly cite a reason for the move, and it was not immediately clear whether the action was linked to a cybersecurity concern, copyright complaint, or another issue. It was also unclear how long the restrictions would remain in place. Access to Supabase has been inconsistent in India over the past several days, with the San Francisco-based company acknowledging the issue in posts on social media starting Wednesday.",
    "paragraph3": "While the restrictions were first reported by Supabase on Reliance Industries’ JioFiber network, users have since flagged similar problems across multiple internet providers and telecom networks. In one post on Friday, Supabase tagged India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, asking him to intervene and restore access, though the company later removed the message and said in a subsequent update that the site remained blocked for many users in the country. We understand many users in India continue to be blocked from accessing Supabase.",

There are also NFC capabilities that others can use to load your contact details should they find a lost device with the tag attached.",
    "paragraph3": "One big differentiator is that unlike Apple’s AirTags, the Xiaomi Tag lacks ultra wideband (UWB) functionality for pinpointing its exact location.

    "excerpt": "Can two declining companies form a profitable one?",
    "paragraph1": "A successful Paramount-WBD merger would be the largest streaming merger ever and would lead to further consolidation in the industry. “What started as a fragmented but flexible streaming ecosystem is increasingly trending toward rebundling—fewer, larger super-platforms offering broader catalogues at higher price points,” Mathur said. Paramount holds on to cable Paramount’s WBD bid is unique in its aggressive push for cable channels, which are struggling with viewership and advertising revenue.",
    "paragraph2": "Under a WBD merger, Paramount would add networks like HGTV, Cartoon Network, TLC, and CNN to its linear TV lineup, which currently includes Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, and CBS. Although Paramount and WBD’s cable businesses are both in decline, they are both profitable. Paramount’s TV/media business, which includes its cable channels and production studios, reported $1.1 billion in adjusted OIBDA in Q4 2025.",
    "paragraph3": "WBD’s cable business posted adjusted EBITDA of $1.41 billion that quarter. Ultimately, a Paramount-WBD merger would put diversity of viewpoints at risk.",

    "excerpt": "Interactions between neighboring materials is mediated by virtual photons.",
    "paragraph1": "Despite the headline, this isn’t really a story about superconductivity—at least not the superconductivity that people care about, the stuff that doesn’t require exotic refrigeration to work. Instead, it’s a story about how superconductivity can be used as a test of some of the weirder consequences of quantum mechanics, one that involves non-existent particles of light that still act as if they exist. Researchers have found a way to get these virtual photons to influence the behavior of a superconductor, ultimately making it worse.",
    "paragraph2": "That may, in the end, tell us something useful about superconductivity, but it’ll probably take a little while. Virtual reality The story starts with quantum field theory, which is incredibly complex, but the simplified version is that even empty space is filled with fields that could govern the interactions of any quantum objects in or near that space. You can think of different particles as energetic excitements of these fields—so a photon is simply an energetic state of the quantum field. Some of these particles have real existences we can track, like a photon emitted by a laser and absorbed by a detector some distance away.",
    "paragraph3": "But the quantum field also allows for virtual photons, which simply act to transmit the electromagnetic force between particles. We can’t really directly detect these, but we can definitely track their effects. One of the stranger consequences of this is that locations that have a strong electromagnetic field can be filled with virtual photons even when no real ones are present.",

The CBP uses drones to track people crossing the border. “Congressional aides told Reuters the Pentagon used the high-energy laser system to shoot down a Customs and Border Protection drone near the Mexican border, in an area that often has incursions from Mexican drones used by drug cartels,” Reuters reported last night.",

The restrictions are in place until June 24 but could be lifted earlier. There are conflicting reports on which day the strike happened, with The New York Times reporting that the strike occurred Thursday and Bloomberg writing that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) “was notified Wednesday after the event occurred.” “The Defense Department didn’t realize the drone was being flown by CBP when it shot it down,” and “had not first coordinated the use of the laser system with the US Federal Aviation Administration,” Bloomberg wrote, citing anonymous sources.",
    "paragraph3": "The military hasn’t been coordinating counter-drone measures with the FAA, and “CBP drone operators didn’t inform the military’s laser unit that it was launching,” Bloomberg wrote, citing anonymous sources. Because the CBP didn’t notify the Defense Department, the military viewed the aircraft as “an unknown drone,” the Times wrote, citing an unnamed Pentagon official. Two laser strikes in February The latest incident came about two weeks after the FAA abruptly closed airspace over El Paso for a few hours, leading to flight cancellations.",

Fresh Coat is a screen protector that Astropad created with an optical-grade anti-reflective coating to reduce glare and provide a better iPhone viewing experience. The technology cuts reflections by 75 percent, while improving contrast and keeping colors vibrant.",
    "paragraph2": "Unlike other anti-reflective screen protectors on the market, Fresh Coat adds no haze or distortion to the ‌iPhone‌'s display. Priced at $30, Fresh Coat is made from a scratch-proof tempered glass that provides protection for the ‌iPhone‌'s display in addition to cutting down on glare and reflections. It's slim and doesn't add bulk to the ‌iPhone‌ even though there are five layers of protective technology at work. From the top down, there's an anti-reflective coating, an oleophobic and hydrophobic coating, a layer of tempered glass, a dust barrier, and an impact-resistant \"airbag\" bonding.",
    "paragraph3": "If you have an ‌iPhone 17‌, it comes with an anti-reflective coating added by Apple. What you might not know is that you can't use just any screen protector with the ‌iPhone 17‌. If you put a regular screen protector without an anti-reflective coating on, it nullifies the anti-reflective properties of that added coating.",

    "paragraph1": "Friday February 27, 2026 7:19 am PST by Joe RossignolMacworld's Filipe Espósito today again reported that Apple appears to be developing two new Studio Display models with different specs. Based on lines of code in \"internal Apple files,\" which likely refers to a macOS Tahoe Kernel Debug Kit that leaked online last year, Espósito continues to believe that both of the new Studio Display models will feature ProMotion, enabling up to a 120Hz refresh rate, as well as HDR support for increased brightness and dynamic range. For the higher-end Studio Display, the report has revealed two more potential upgrades that had yet to be rumored until now, including superior speakers and more and/or higher-spec ports.",
    "paragraph2": "Apple says the current Studio Display has a \"high-fidelity six-speaker system\" that supports Spatial Audio, and the monitor has one Thunderbolt 3 port that connects to and charges a Mac, and three USB-C ports for connecting accessories. The new Studio Display will likely feature at least one Thunderbolt 5 port, to ensure there is enough bandwidth for both 5K resolution at 120Hz and accessories. However, another leaker curiously claimed that at least one of the new Studio Display models will max out at 90Hz, so we will have to see which of these rumors is accurate. A boost to the current 60Hz refresh rate can make videos and scrolling look smoother to the eye.",
    "paragraph3": "Espósito said that the higher-end Studio Display could have a 32-inch screen, whereas the lower-end model would likely stick with a 27-inch screen. However, this particular claim was merely speculation, rather than info from the internal Apple files. Keep in mind that with a 32-inch screen, 5K resolution would not be Retina quality, so the resolution would have to increase to 6K like on Apple's higher-end Pro Display XDR.",

Design The 12th-generation ‌iPad‌ isn't going to get a design update this year, and we're expecting it to have the same 11-inch edge-to-edge display with Touch ID Side Button and thick bezels.",
    "paragraph2": "Apple last updated the ‌iPad‌'s design with the 10th-generation model, giving the device a more modern look to better match the designs of the iPad Pro and iPad Air models. It's still a relatively new design, and Apple doesn't update the low-cost ‌iPad‌'s chassis often. The low-cost ‌iPad‌ is only available in a single screen size, and it is Apple's thickest tablet at 7mm. It features a Retina LCD display with no ProMotion support, no P3 wide color, and no lamination (display technology that cuts down on glare, provides a more responsive feel, and allows for a thinner size) compared to Apple's other tablets.",
    "paragraph3": "Apple makes the low-cost ‌iPad‌ in several fun colors, and we could see some new shades in 2026. Current colors include blue, pink, silver, and yellow. No changes are expected for the rear camera, front camera, USB-C port, or compatibility with accessories like the Apple Pencil.",

    "paragraph1": "Friday February 27, 2026 4:56 am PST by Tim HardwickApple has asked a federal judge to dismiss a proposed class action lawsuit accusing the company of defrauding shareholders by overstating Siri's Apple Intelligence capabilities and misrepresenting its compliance with the Epic Games App Store injunction. At WWDC in June 2024, Apple previewed two of Siri's most anticipated Apple Intelligence upgrades – personal context and onscreen awareness. The features were supposed to arrive as part of iOS 18 and were promoted the same year when launching the iPhone 16 models, but Apple is still working on them.",
    "paragraph2": "In 2025, CEO Tim Cook acknowledged in 2025 that developing a \"more personal\" Siri was \"taking a bit longer than we thought.\" The delay led Apple to be accused in a March 2025 lawsuit of false advertising and unfair competition. But in a Wednesday filing in San Jose federal court covered by Reuters, Apple argued there is no proof executives knew at the time that either feature would be significantly delayed. Apple's motion also pushed back on separate claims related to the Epic Games injunction, which required the company to let developers link users to external purchase options outside the App Store's 30 percent commission structure.",
    "paragraph3": "Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found Apple in \"willful violation\" of that injunction last year after the company introduced a new system that still charged developers a 27 percent fee on some external sales. A federal appeals court partially reversed her sanctions in December. Apple said it never guaranteed its compliance procedures would be foolproof, and argued the fraud claims were unsubstantiated.",

Existing propulsion solutions often lack the agility, responsiveness, and thrust required for these demands.

ISPTech is positioning its technology to address these trends.",

The company offers an AI agent, Agent0, which acts as a copilot, helping users find the root cause of issues faster.In October, Dash0 announced it had raised a $35m Series A funding round, backed by Accel, Cherry Ventures and Dig Ventures. On Friday, Bloomberg reported the company was in talks with London-based Balderton Capital to lead a fresh round of funding, which would value Dash0 at $1bn, making it the latest European startup to achieve unicorn status.",
    "paragraph3": "Founder and CEO Mirko Novakovic previously told Sifted it was unclear how many European investors would contribute to future fundraises, saying he had taken investment from Cherry Ventures in part to increase the region’s representation on the company’s cap table. “There are not so many European funds who can do A, B, C at some stages. So I said ‘Probably this A round is the last chance for me to get a German or European VC in,’” he said.",

The investment marks the company’s first institutional round following eight years of self-funded growth.",
    "paragraph2": "The raise comes as Europe’s drone market faces growing reliance on non-European technologies, particularly components originating in China. Dependencies in areas such as batteries and flight controllers are increasingly viewed as potential risks to defence readiness. Founded in 2017 by engineers with backgrounds in aerospace and competitive aeromodelling, FlyFocus was built on the premise that trusted, European-controlled supply chains and technological sovereignty are important for military security. Its systems are manufactured using components sourced exclusively from NATO-aligned suppliers, a policy the company says supports supply-chain transparency and compliance with European defence procurement requirements.",

    "fullText": "My indulgence in the intricacies of custom mechanical keyboards is a product of nothing but boredom. Starting with an old keyboard with Outemu Blue switches, I moved on to the Monsgeek MG75W. But one thing that remained unchanged was the switches: the Akko CS Lavender Purples.\nSadly enough, two years down the line, the Lavender Purples are all but usable. They are under the weather with constant problems with double-clicking and hit registers. That left me with no option but to put them to rest, providing me with an opportunity. One that allowed me to correct the mistake I made two years ago: picking tactiles over linears.\nAs of publishing this article, I have spent three days with the KTT Hyacinths and the KTT Wine Reds. After hours of gaming, content writing, and taking a couple of online tests, I am impressed. Let’s talk about these switches and my transition to linear switches from tactiles.\n\nSwitch Specifications\nMechanical keyboard switches are products that cannot be measured in terms of quality. You can measure frame rates for computer components, or battery life for a laptop or a phone. However, there is no such numeric evaluation when it comes to mechanical switches; it is totally down to the user’s personal preference.\nRegardless, I believe it is good to take a look at the specifications, since they can give you a preliminary, albeit vague idea of how these linear switches might be.\n\nSmoothness of the Switches\nLet’s get down to what truly matters. Both switches are linear, from the same brand, but they do have some differences.\nIn terms of pure smoothness, the Hyacinths win over the Wine Reds. That said, when you bring the switches close to your ears, you can notice some minor scratchiness. This is very common with unlubed switches, like the ones in discussion. The Wine Reds, on the other hand, are not too scratchy. In fact, both switches are incredibly smooth and nice to type with. But the Hyacinths take the crown when it comes to smoothness.\nBut we must remember that some scratchiness persists when unlubed. The only way to get rid of that, of course, is to spend some time at the lubing station. I have not gotten around to lubing these switches yet. However, my online research suggests that both switches can get mesmerisingly smooth when lubed. I look forward to having more time to lube my linears and experiencing the joy of typing with lubed switches.\nTyping Experience & Feel\nWhat about the typing experience? To give you a good idea, let’s go to the table. As you can see, both switches have the same bottom-out force. But in reality, the Wine Reds feel significantly lighter compared to the Hyacinths. Let’s figure out why.\nTaking a closer look, we can observe that the Wine Reds have a 12.5% greater travel distance. However, it has the same actuation force as the Hyacinths. As a result, the same amount of force causes the Wine Red stem to go further down than the Hyacinth stem. Thus, the Hyacinths feel somewhat heavier and more snappy.\n\nDifferent Mounting Systems\nThe Hyacinths have a 5-pin mounting system, an upgrade from the 3-pin Wine Reds. This gives the Hyacinths more stability in general. On top of that, it gives users the freedom to go plateless.\nHowever, I did not expect the 5-pin switches to have this tight a fit. With the 3-pin Red Wines and Lavender Purples, taking the switches out is but a breeze. But moving on to the Hyacinths, it is more of a struggle. I have to wiggle the switch back and forth and struggle a little bit to take it out without any damage. Nevertheless, I believe I will get used to it with time.\n\nThe Eye-Candy Factor\nLet’s be honest, looks don’t matter when the switches are covered by keycaps anyway. However, we must keep in mind that there are people who use transparent keycaps or care about them for no apparent reason. And how can they not? Keyboard switches look so cute nowadays, you might mistake them for candies.\nThe KTT Wine Reds, albeit being incredibly simple in looks, are very aesthetically pleasing. A clear top housing, an opaque white bottom housing, and a magenta stem, and it looks splendid. Nothing too exceptional, nothing over the top, but minimalism at its finest. But it’s a different story when it comes to the Hyacinths.\nYellow stem and purple housing – a combination I have never seen in any switch other than the Hyacinths. KTT clearly decided to try something new with their new switch, named after a flower. Does it look appealing? It sure does. The top housing is pale purple, a minor contrast from the bottom housing with a darker tone. The yellow stem perfectly complements the purples in this case.\nOne subtle touch I appreciate is the minimal branding. Just a faint engraving. In fact, I initially missed the engraving on the KTT Hyacinths. This is a stark contrast with other companies going all-in with the company name on top housing.\nSwitch Assembly\nThe Hyacinths have a reinforced interlocking rail system to attach the top housing to the bottom one. In contrast, the Wine Reds use the Kailh system. This is something to keep in mind when purchasing a switch opener. Both of these switches are reasonably tight, so filming is deemed unnecessary.\nThe 5-pin and 3-pin mounting systems\nSwitching over from Tactile Switches\nDo you know why I picked tactiles two years ago? Because I presumed my habituation with clicky Outemu Blues would translate better to tactiles. After the switches showed up at my door, I immediately realized those switches were not what I expected. The tactile bump was much more pronounced than anticipated.\nI later had the opportunity to try out some linear switches at the studio. It was clear – I should have gotten linears. Two years later, I have had the opportunity to correct my old mistake. So, how did I do this time?\nI am satisfied with the new switches. In terms of adaptation, it was effortless. However, on extremely rare occasions, I will miss a click. The lack of a bump means there is no tactile sensation when a hit is registered. So sometimes, I might not push the stem deep enough. Aside from that, the experience is fabulous.\nSound\nWhen I first purchased the Monsgeek MG75W, I was not quite satisfied with the sound. No amount of modification gave me the desired sound profile; the thocc seemed like a far cry. One switch replacement later, I am satisfied with the acoustics. Turns out, the Lavender Purples were the real culprit behind that clack. The sound profile of the Wine Reds has a slightly higher pitch compared to the Hyacinths. However, both switches sound deeper than their Akko CS predecessors. Here is a sound test of the Hyacinths:\nhttps://pcbuilderbd.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Sound-Test.mp3I have only ordered a handful of Wine Reds for the numbers row and punctuation keys. Therefore, I apologise for not being able to record a proper sound test with them.\nVerdict\nBoth the KTT Hyacinths and the KTT Wine Reds came out to me as smooth and cost-effective switches. Redditors report that the KTT Hyacinths are smoother than the Gateron Milky Yellows. However, I am unable to confirm this claim, since I have not tried the Gaterons in a long time. Nevertheless, the KTT Hyacinths are amazing switches for the price. I can safely recommend them to anybody looking for linears if these switches fit your budget.\nThe KTT Wine Reds are gems at a budget. I did not expect a switch this cheap to be this smooth and sound this good. If it is your first time with mechanical switches, you might want to give it a shot. I cannot, however, compare it to the Leobog Graywoods since I have never used them.\nI will conclude this article by stating that I am satisfied with the switches. My stance will remain unchanged as long as the switches keep supporting me.",

    "fullText": "SUMMARYIndia’s manufacturing sector is growing faster than the global average, backed by strong domestic and export demand, the China+1 shift, and a rising share of medium- and high-tech industries in overall value addition\nWith initiatives such as India Semiconductor Mission 2.0, rare earth corridors and targeted SME funding in the Union Budget 2026, the government is accelerating the shift towards a product-led, manufacturing-driven economy\nRecognising this, Inc42 is launching the first edition of “5 Manufacturing Startups To Watch”, highlighting startups driving innovation in defence tech, clean mobility, semiconductor packaging and electronics hardware\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIndia’s manufacturing renaissance is unfolding in real time. While global manufacturing output grew a modest 0.7% in Q3 2025, India recorded 1.3% growth in the same period, helped by a strong domestic and export demand, as well as China+1 supply chain shift.\nFactory floors are humming louder each quarter as Indian manufacturers produce everything from batteries and chemicals to composites for indigenous jets and electric vehicles. \n\n\n\n\nAs many as 7.47 Cr MSMEs and small startups form the industrial backbone of the country, delivering 35.4% of the total output, accounting for 48.6% of the exports, and employing 32.8 Cr people. \nBut the biggest silver lining, as per Economic Survey 2025-26, is that medium- and high-technology industries now contribute 46.3% of India’s manufacturing value added. This signals a gradual shift towards more sophisticated production structures. \nThis also places India among a smaller group of middle-income economies steadily advancing up the manufacturing value chain. On its part, the government, too, is also leaving no stone unturned to shift the country from a services-led economy to a product-led one. \nThe Union Budget 2026 further paves this trajectory. From announcing India Semiconductor Mission 2.0 and rare earth corridors to container manufacturing and ₹10,000 Cr SME Growth Fund support, the economic blueprint recognised India’s need to push both frontier technologies and manufacturing-led scale. \nStartups are seizing this moment and tackling India’s manufacturing gaps with precision.

    "fullText": "Hammad Khalid has been appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of MCB Islamic Bank, marking a leadership transition at one of the country’s leading Islamic banking institutions. He succeeds Zargham Khan Durrani, who previously held the position. The appointment places a long-serving MCB group executive at the helm during a period of steady growth for the bank.\nMr. Khalid has been associated with MCB Islamic Bank as a member of its Board of Directors since June 2022, where he played a role in strategic planning and governance matters. His elevation to the top executive role reflects continuity in leadership rather than a shift in direction.\nA chartered accountant by profession, Mr. Khalid is a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan. He brings more than 16 years of experience with MCB Bank Limited, where he most recently served as Chief Financial Officer. In that role, he was closely involved in financial planning, capital management and regulatory engagement, while also representing the bank at both local and international forums.\nBeyond his executive responsibilities, Mr. Khalid also holds board positions across the financial services sector. These include directorships at 1LINK (Pvt.) Limited, MCB NBCO Azerbaijan and MCB Exchange, highlighting his exposure to banking operations beyond Pakistan’s domestic market.\nMCB Islamic Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of MCB Bank Limited and continues to expand its footprint across the country. It currently operates 307 branches and two sub-branches nationwide. During the first nine months of the outgoing calendar year, the bank reported a profit of Rs1.7 billion, reflecting stable performance in a challenging economic environment.",

    "fullText": "Signatories\n      Be the first to sign this letter.\n    \n\n\n    \n      Add Your Name\n      \n        Current and former employees of Google and OpenAI are invited to sign.\n        You may sign anonymously. All signatures are verified before being published.\n      \n\n      \n\n      \n    \n\n    \n      Frequently Asked Questions\n\n      \n        Have you thought about broadening the requests to be more comprehensive?\n        The goal of this letter is to find common ground. The signatories likely have a diverse set of views. The current situation with the DoW is so clear-cut that it can bring together a very broad coalition. Signing this letter doesn't mean you think it's the only thing that needs to be done, just that you agree with the bottom line.\n      \n      \n      \n        Who is behind this?\n        This letter was organized by a few citizens who are concerned about the potential misuse of AI against Americans. We are not affiliated with any political party, advocacy group, or organization. We are not affiliated with any AI company and are not paid.\n      \n\n      \n        Who can sign?\n        Current and former employees of Google and OpenAI are invited to sign. We verify every signature to ensure authenticity. You may sign anonymously.\n      \n\n      \n        How is my data handled?\n        If you sign anonymously, your personal information (name, email) is automatically and permanently deleted from our database within 24 hours of verification. After deletion, only your anonymous public listing remains (e.g. \"Anonymous, verified current employee at [Company]\"). Only one organizer has access to review anonymous signatures during that 24-hour window. No one else can see your identity.\n        If you sign publicly, we store your name and affiliation to display on the letter. Email addresses used for verification are never published or shared.\n      \n\n      \n        What if I accidentally fill out the form twice?\n        Don't worry. We de-duplicate non-anonymous signatures automatically, and anonymous signatures within 24 hours (before personal data is deleted). For anonymous signatories beyond 24 hours, we cannot verify there are no duplicates, though there is one human who manually reads all signatures and will try hard to notice and correct any abuse of the system.\n      \n\n      \n        I signed anonymously but now want to put my name on it. How can I fix that?\n        Sign again using the \"Alternative verification\" method. In the verification details, mention that you previously signed anonymously and would like to switch to a named signature. We'll update your entry and make sure you're not double-counted.\n      \n\n      \n        How do you verify signatures?\n        Every signature is verified before it appears on the letter. If you sign using the Google Form or email verification options, we confirm that you have access to a @google.com or @openai.com email address. If you use alternative verification, an organizer manually reviews your proof of employment. No signature is published without verification.\n      \n\n      \n        Have there been any mistakes in signature verification for this letter?\n        We are aware of two mistakes in our efforts to verify the signatures in the form so far. One person who was not an employee of OpenAI or Google found a bug in our verification system and signed falsely under the name \"You guys are letting China Win\". This was noticed and fixed in under 10 minutes, and the verification system was improved to prevent mistakes like this from happening again. We also had two people submit twice in a way that our automatic de-duplication didn't catch. We do periodic checks for this.\n\n          Because of anonymity considerations, all signatures are manually reviewed by one fallible human. We do our best to make sure we catch and correct any mistakes, but we are not perfect and will probably make mistakes. We will log those mistakes here as we find them.\n        \n      \n\n      \n        What infrastructure does this site use and is it secure?\n        This site is hosted on Fly.io, a US-based infrastructure provider. The database is SQLite, stored on an encrypted persistent volume. Verification emails are sent via Resend. Google Forms is used as one verification option because it allows email confirmation without sending anything to your inbox. The site itself is a simple open-source Flask application. No analytics or tracking scripts are used. DNS and SSL are managed through Cloudflare.",

    "fullText": "Why am I writing this today?\nBecause I am deeply concerned about users losing their most sacred data.Over the past year or two, I’ve seen many organizations, large and small, implement passkeys (which is great, thank you!) and use the PRF (Pseudo-Random Function) extension to derive keys to protect user data, typically to support end-to-end encryption (including backups).\nI’ve also seen a number of influential folks and organizations promote the use of PRF for encrypting data.The primary use cases I’ve seen implemented or promoted so far include:encrypting message backups (including images and videos)end-to-end encryptionencrypting documents and other filesencrypting and unlocking crypto walletscredential manager unlockinglocal account sign inWhy is this a problem?When you overload a credential used for authentication by also using it for encryption, the “blast radius” for losing that credential becomes immeasurably larger.Imagine a user named Erika. They are asked to set up encrypted backups in their favorite messaging app because they don’t want to lose their messages and photos, especially those of loved ones who are no longer here.\nErika is prompted to use their passkey to enable these backups.There is nothing in the UI that emphasizes that these backups are now tightly coupled to their passkey. Even if there were explanatory text, Erika, like most users, doesn’t typically read through every dialog box, and they certainly can’t be expected to remember this technical detail a year from now.A few months pass, and Erika decides to clean up their credential manager. They don’t remember why they had a specific passkey for a messaging app and deletes it.Fast forward a year: they get a new phone and set up the messaging app. They aren’t prompted to use a passkey because one no longer exists in their credential manager. Instead, they use phone number verification to recover their account. They are then guided through the “restore backup” flow and prompted for their passkey.Since they no longer have it, they are informed that they cannot access their backed up data. Goodbye, memories.Here’s a few examples of what a user sees when they delete a passkey:Example: deleting a passkey in Apple PasswordsExample: deleting a passkey in Google Password ManagerExample: deleting a passkey in BitwardenHow is a user supposed to understand that they are potentially blowing away photos of deceased relatives, an encrypted property deed, or their digital currency?We cannot, and should not, expect users to know this.At this point, you may be asking why PRF is part of WebAuthn in the first place.\nThere are some very legitimate and more durable uses of PRF in WebAuthn, specifically supporting credential managers and operating systems.A passkey with PRF can make unlocking your credential manager (where all of your other passkeys and credentials are stored) much faster and more secure.\nCredential managers have robust mechanisms to protect your vault data with multiple methods, such as master passwords, per-device keys, recovery keys, and social recovery keys.\nLosing access to a passkey used to unlock your credential manager rarely leads to complete loss of your vault data.PRF is already implemented in WebAuthn Clients and Credential Managers, so the cat is out of the bag. My asks:To the wider identity industry: please stop promoting and using passkeys to encrypt user data. I’m begging you. Let them be great, phishing-resistant authentication credentials.To credential managers: please prioritize adding warnings for users when they delete a passkey with PRF (and displaying the RP’s info page when available)To sites and services using passkeys: if you still need to use PRF knowing these concerns, please:add an informational page to your support site explaining how you’re using passkeys for more than authenticationlist that page URL in the Well-Known URL for Relying Party Passkey Endpoints (prfUsageDetails)provide as much warning as possible up front to users when enabling itThanks for reading! 🙏🏻(and thanks to Matthew Miller for reviewing and providing feedback on this post)",

    "fullText": "Šibensko-kninska županija očišćena od minaFoto: HTV / HRTInterior Minister Davor Božinović announced Friday that Croatia is officially free of landmines. Thirty-one years after the end of the Homeland War, all known minefields have been cleared — a major milestone for the country.The decades-long effort came at a heavy cost. Over three decades of painstaking and dangerous work, 208 people lost their lives, including 41 deminers. The total cost of clearing the country is estimated at around 1.2 billion euros.\n“Croatia is free of land mines. After nearly 30 years, we have completed demining in accordance with the Ottawa Convention,” Božinović said during an event marking International Civil Protection Day in Zagreb.\nHe added, “Almost 107,000 mines and 407,000 pieces of unexploded ordnance have been removed. This is not just a technical success — it is the fulfillment of a moral obligation to the victims of mines and their families. A mine-free Croatia means safer families, better development of rural areas, more farmland, and stronger tourism.”",

    "fullText": "Supabase, a popular developer database platform, is facing disruptions in India — one of its key markets — has been blocked in India, TechCrunch has learned. New Delhi ordered internet providers to block its website, resulting in patchy access across networks.\n\nThe blocking order was issued on February 24 under Section 69A of India’s Information Technology Act, according to a source familiar with the matter. The provision empowers the government to restrict public access to online content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Indian government did not publicly cite a reason for the move, and it was not immediately clear whether the action was linked to a cybersecurity concern, copyright complaint, or another issue. It was also unclear how long the restrictions would remain in place.\n\nAccess to Supabase has been inconsistent in India over the past several days, with the San Francisco-based company acknowledging the issue in posts on social media starting Wednesday. While the restrictions were first reported by Supabase on Reliance Industries’ JioFiber network, users have since flagged similar problems across multiple internet providers and telecom networks. In one post on Friday, Supabase tagged India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, asking him to intervene and restore access, though the company later removed the message and said in a subsequent update that the site remained blocked for many users in the country.\n\n\nWe understand many users in India continue to be blocked from accessing Supabase. We acknowledge the difficulties this is causing for our users there. Supabase continues to follow up through all available channels to resolve this issue.We continue to advise affected customers…— Supabase (@supabase) February 27, 2026\n\n\nAn Indian founder, who asked not to be named to avoid potential repercussions, told TechCrunch they had stopped seeing new user sign-ups from India over the past two to three days. A technology consultant working with local startups, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were unable to reliably access Supabase for both development and production purposes.\n\nWhile Supabase suggested workarounds such as switching DNS settings or using a VPN (which reroute internet traffic to bypass local restrictions), the founder said such steps were not practical for most end users.\n\nAt the time of publication, TechCrunch was able to verify that supabase.co remained inaccessible on ACT Fibernet, JioFiber and Airtel connections in New Delhi. However, two users on ACT Fibernet in Bengaluru said they were still able to access the service, suggesting the restrictions may be unevenly implemented.\n\n\t\t\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nA screenshot showing Supabase’s access blocked on ACT FibernetImage Credits:Screenshot / Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch\n\nNotably, Supabase’s main website remained accessible in India — but its underlying developer infrastructure did not.\n\nIndia is Supabase’s fourth-largest source of traffic, accounting for about 9% of global visits, according to data from Similarweb, highlighting the potential fallout for the country’s developer ecosystem. The platform’s global traffic jumped more than 111% year over year to about 4.2 million visits in January. In India, visits rose roughly 179% to about 365,000, compared with a 168.5% increase in the U.S. to about 627,000.\n\nThe incident highlights broader concerns about India’s website blocking regime, said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“This is a simple fact that has grave consequences for developers and others,” he told TechCrunch. “You don’t know where you can safely run projects without the danger that something might happen where it gets blocked, and suddenly you’re scrambling to find a way.” \n\nIndia has previously faced criticism over broad website blocking measures. In 2014, authorities briefly restricted access to developer platform GitHub, along with services such as Vimeo, Pastebin and Weebly, during a security probe. Users on some Indian networks in 2023 also reported that a key GitHub content domain had been blocked by certain ISPs, according to earlier reports.\n\nFounded in 2020 by CEO Paul Copplestone and CTO Ant Wilson, Supabase positions itself as an open-source alternative to Firebase built on PostgreSQL. The startup has gained traction amid rising interest in so-called “vibe coding” tools and AI-driven app development, and has raised about $380 million across three funding rounds since September 2024, lifting its valuation to $5 billion.\n\nIndia’s Ministry of Electronics and IT, as well as telecom providers including ACT Fibernet, Bharti Airtel, and Reliance Jio, did not respond to requests for comment. Copplestone and Wilson also did not respond.\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "fullText": "In a newly released deposition filed in Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, the tech executive attacked OpenAI’s safety record, claiming that his company, xAI, better prioritizes safety.  He went so far as to say that “Nobody has committed suicide because of Grok, but apparently they have because of ChatGPT.”\n\nThe comment came up in a line of questioning about a public letter Musk signed in March 2023. In it, he called on AI labs to pause development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, OpenAI’s flagship model at the time, for at least six months. The letter, which was signed by over 1,100 people, including many AI experts, stated there was not enough planning and management taking place at AI labs, as they were locked in an “out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one — not even their creators — can understand, predict, or reliably control.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose fears have since gained credibility. OpenAI now faces a series of lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT’s manipulative conversation tactics have led several people to experience negative mental health effects, with some dying by suicide. Musk’s comment suggests that these incidents could be used as fodder in his case against OpenAI.\n\nThe transcript of Musk’s video testimony, which took place back in September, was filed publicly this week, ahead of the expected jury trial next month.\n\nThe lawsuit against OpenAI centers on the company’s shift from a nonprofit AI research lab to a for-profit company, which Musk claims violated its founding agreements. As part of his arguments, Musk claims that AI safety could be compromised by OpenAI’s commercial relationships, as such relationships would place speed, scale, and revenue above safety concerns.\n\nHowever, since that recording, xAI has faced safety concerns of its own. Last month, Musk’s social network X was flooded with nonconsensual nude images generated by xAI’s Grok, some of which were said to be of minors. This led the California Attorney General’s office to open an investigation into the matter. The EU is also running its own investigation, and other governments have taken action, too, with some imposing blocks and bans.\n\nIn the newly filed deposition, Musk claimed he had signed the AI safety letter because “it seemed like a good idea,” not because he had just incorporated an AI company looking to compete with OpenAI.\n\n“I signed it, as many people did, to urge caution with AI development,” Musk said. “I just wanted … AI safety to be prioritized.”\n\nImage Credits:imgflip\n\nMusk also responded to other questions in the deposition, including those about artificial general intelligence, or AGI — the concept of AI that can match or surpass human reasoning across a broad range of tasks — saying “it has a risk.” He also confirmed that he “was mistaken” about his supposed $100 million donation to OpenAI; the second amended complaint in the case puts the actual figure closer to $44.8 million.\n\nHe also recalled why OpenAI was founded, which, from his perspective, was because he was “increasingly concerned about the danger of Google being a monopoly in AI,” adding that his conversations with Google co-founder Larry Page were “alarming, in that he did not seem to be taking AI safety seriously.” OpenAI was formed as a counterweight to that threat, Musk claimed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011. She joined the company after having previously spent over three years at ReadWriteWeb.

OpenAI also shared that it now has 50 million paying subscribers.\n\n“Subscriber momentum accelerated meaningfully to start the year, with January and February on track to be the largest months for new subscribers in our history,” the company wrote in a blog post. “People use ChatGPT to learn, write, plan, and build. As usage scales, the product improves in ways people feel immediately: faster responses, higher reliability, stronger safety, and more consistent performance.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new weekly active user figure marks a jump of 100 million users from the 800 million that OpenAI reported in October 2025.\n\nOpenAI shared the new numbers as part of its announcement that it has raised $110 billion in private funding, marking one of the largest private funding rounds in history. The new funding includes a $50 billion investment from Amazon, along with $30 billion each from Nvidia and SoftBank, at a $730 billion pre-money valuation. The round remains open, and the company expects more investors to join. \n\n\tTopics",

Stevie started out at Laptop Mag writing news and reviews on hardware, gaming, and AI.NASA announced at a press conference on Friday that it’s delaying its plans for a Moon landing until Artemis IV in 2028. The Artemis III mission, scheduled for 2027, was originally going to attempt to land on the Moon but will now be a test flight instead. NASA also says it’s “increasing its cadence of missions,” including adding a second test flight in 2027 and aiming for “at least one surface landing every year thereafter,” including the Artemis IV landing.The overhaul to the Artemis launch schedule follows a report from NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) earlier this month that highlighted serious safety risks with NASA’s previous plans for future launches. ASAP was particularly concerned about Artemis III, which its report said included too many “cumulative technical, operational, and schedule risks associated with multiple first-of-a-kind objectives planned for a single mission.”The Artemis II mission, scheduled for this year, has faced a string of issues during testing over recent weeks, delaying its launch until no earlier than April. Artemis II is intended to orbit the Moon — if it’s successful, it will be the first time humans visit lunar orbit since Apollo 17 in 1972.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Stevie BonifieldThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)",

    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance’s merger agreement is now official. On Friday, the two companies announced plans to merge into a massive media company that will fold WBD’s studio, linear channels, streaming service, and gaming segment into Paramount.Though WBD initially signed onto an $83 billion agreement to merge part of Warner Bros. with Netflix, Paramount persisted with a hostile takeover bid, followed by a series of offers. That persistence paid off, as WBD determined that Paramount’s “best and final” offer is “superior” to Netflix’s deal. On Thursday, Netflix declined to match Paramount’s bid, calling it “no longer financially attractive.”Paramount and WBD say the board of directors of both companies has signed off on the deal. The companies expect it to close in the third quarter of 2026, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. Under the agreement, Paramount will acquire WBD in a deal valued at $110 billion. Paramount has also agreed to cover the $7 billion regulatory termination fee and the $2.8 billion breakup fee owed to Netflix, which it has already paid, according to Bloomberg.“Together, Paramount and WBD will deliver greater choice for consumers through its leading streaming platforms with an exceptional intellectual property portfolio that has produced popular franchises such as Game of Thrones, Mission Impossible, Harry Potter, Top Gun, the DC Universe and SpongeBob SquarePants,” the companies say in the press release.If approved, the deal would transform Paramount into an entertainment behemoth. Skydance only just completed its acquisition of Paramount last August, putting David Ellison, the son of Oracle co-founder and President Donald Trump ally Larry Ellison, into the CEO role. Ellison has made a number of changes at the Paramount-owned CBS News, including installing The Free Press founder Bari Weiss as editor-in-chief. These changes have raised concerns among staff members at CNN, according to Variety.Lawmakers and regulators are skeptical about the Paramount-WBD merger. “A handful of Trump-aligned billionaires are trying to seize control of what you watch and charge you whatever price they want,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said in a statement. California Attorney General Rob Bonta also warned that the agreement isn’t a “done deal,” and that the state’s Department of Justice will be “vigorous” in its review of the merger.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Emma Roth",

Stevie started out at Laptop Mag writing news and reviews on hardware, gaming, and AI.The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, is getting a new acting director, as reported by ABC, less than a year after Madhu Gottumukkala took charge of the agency as deputy director and acting director in May 2025.CISA’s executive assistant director for cybersecurity, Nick Andersen, will become the agency’s new acting director while Gottumkkala will now be serving as director of strategic implementation at DHS. The leadership change comes just a month after reports that Gottumkkala uploaded sensitive documents to ChatGPT. Gottumkkala had requested special permission to use ChatGPT, despite the AI being off-limits for other DHS employees.Gottumkkala’s departure follows a downturn at CISA over the past year as the agency has been “gutted and politicized” by the Trump administration, resulting in budget cuts, layoffs, and wavering trust from local leaders. CISA is also still without a Senate-confirmed director. Trump nominated Sean Plankey for the role last year, then renominated him in January. Plankey previously served in the first Trump administration.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Stevie Bonifield",

    "fullText": "On Thursday morning, I attended a Q&A panel with four top Samsung smartphone executives. Until 2025, Samsung was the world’s largest smartphone manufacturer, and by association, the world’s largest maker of cameras. It’s still the second largest after Apple.Samsung handed me the microphone first. I asked:We see a divide in society between people who want AI to do impressive things with their photos and videos, and those who don’t want AI to do anything with photos and videos because it’s eroding our ability to believe that what we have seen is real, destroying the concept of photographic evidence.Metadata tools like C2PA have utterly failed to stem the tide. Does Samsung have any new and different ideas on how to prevent AI images from taking over the world?Samsung’s four executives did not have any new and different ideas to share.I will credit Won-Joon Choi, the mobile division’s COO and R&D chief, for not dodging the question. He told the room that the erosion of reality is a problem and he wants to fix it.But he, and other Samsung executives, suggested that the company needs to balance the desire for photographic reality with letting smartphone buyers be “more creative.” They passed the buck by suggesting it’s an industry-wide problem, one that requires a broader conversation, and suggested that Samsung has already partially solved it simply by adding a watermark to AI-generated images. A watermark that can easily be removed.Given an opening later, an exec suggested our feelings toward AI-generated content might become more favorable in the future.Here are some of those answers.“We recognize the issue, because a lot of content is generated by AI,” Choi began. “On the one hand, people want to be more creative, so we believe we have to provide a solution so people can be more creative,” he said. “On the other hand, it’s really hard nowadays to distinguish the real photos and videos from the fake ones. I think this is a problem, we recognize that, and I think it’s a problem we have to solve at an industry level.”“The C2PA, you may view it as a failure, but it’s still enough to provide a mechanism if people want to validate that those pictures and videos are made by AI. I think we have to provide a mechanism so people can use it. I think it’s an ongoing effort throughout the industry to solve this problem,” he added.“I think if we make joint efforts to solve this problem, I believe that we should be able to do it,” he concluded.As my colleague Jess Weatherbed wrote earlier this week, we’re starting to worry that this sort of “the industry will solve this together” rhetoric, and the C2PA itself, are substitutes for actual meaningful action.Perhaps responding to our Samsung AI slop watch reporting, Samsung America exec Dave Das also chimed in to say that the company’s still learning about how much AI is acceptable when creating its own ads. He admitted that the company has “just started utilizing some AI content in our creative, and the feedback has been pretty clear.”“We’re trying to discern what is the right place to use it, and absolutely how to be very clear about when we are using AI generated content vs naturally generated content,” Das said.But Das still frames it as a balancing act between business priorities, not a social responsibility. “It really boils down to giving the creator choice,” he said, suggesting that Samsung’s job is to find “the right balance.”Later in the morning, KTLA-TV tech reporter Rich DeMuro felt out Samsung’s stance with a very different question. He asked whether Samsung might want to make it easier for customers to remove its AI watermark from AI-generated photos.“If I’m making a Christmas card with all your fun tools, do I really want that to say ‘AI-generated content?’” asked DeMuro.Drew Blackard, Samsung America’s SVP of mobile product management, took that one. He concluded by saying that “If we feel like consumers really want that ability to remove watermarks, and there are other ways to address the first point around authenticity at the same time, we’ll do both things and deliver the best of what people are wanting out of the experiences.”“At least right now, there’s enough concern from consumers around authenticity that that’s the primary thing we’ve solved for, in terms of the watermarking both in the metadata and on the photo itself. Not all services do that,” he said.Blackard also suggested we might look back one day and realize that AI-generated content isn’t such a big deal, that our perceptions might change over time, the same way perceptions changed toward user-generated content to begin with. People were concerned then with “the amount of content now flowing into the system” and how it wasn’t the professional video product they were used to, he said.I wonder if Samsung and fellow smartphone makers have considered the opposite: that perceptions of AI-generated imagery might become even less favorable after people lose their jobs in favor of cheap-to-produce AI slop, and after it becomes far easier to lie and cheat and steal in the absence of reliable recorded evidence.I wonder if they’ve considered solving this problem ”at an industry level” before they break the dam, and whether perception might turn against Samsung for helping create the flood that comes after.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Sean Hollister",

    "fullText": "Google and other browser makers require that all TLS certificates be published in public transparency logs, which are append-only distributed ledgers. Website owners can then check the logs in real time to ensure that no rogue certificates have been issued for the domains they use. The transparency programs were implemented in response to the 2011 hack of Netherlands-based DigiNotar, which allowed the minting of 500 counterfeit certificates for Google and other websites, some of which were used to spy on web users in Iran.\nOnce viable, Shor’s algorithm could be used to forge classical encryption signatures and break classical encryption public keys of the certificate logs. Ultimately, an attacker could forge signed certificate timestamps used to prove to a browser or operating system that a certificate has been registered when it hasn’t.\nTo rule out this possibility, Google is adding cryptographic material from quantum-resistant algorithms such as ML-DSA. This addition would allow forgeries only if an attacker were to break both classical and post-quantum encryption. The new regime is part of what Google is calling the quantum-resistant root store, which will complement the Chrome Root Store the company formed in 2022.\nThe MTCs use Merkle Trees to provide quantum-resistant assurances that a certificate has been published without having to add most of the lengthy keys and hashes. Using other techniques to reduce the data sizes, the MTCs will be roughly the same 64-byte length they are now, Westerbaan said.\nThe new system has already been implemented in Chrome. For the time being, Cloudflare is enrolling roughly 1,000 TLS certificates to test how well the MTCs work. For now, Cloudflare is generating the distributed ledger. The plan is for CAs to eventually fill that role. The Internet Engineering Task Force standards body has recently formed a working group called the PKI, Logs, And Tree Signatures, which is coordinating with other key players to develop a long-term solution.\n“We view the adoption of MTCs and a quantum-resistant root store as a critical opportunity to ensure the robustness of the foundation of today’s ecosystem,” Google’s Friday blog post said. “By designing for the specific demands of a modern, agile internet, we can accelerate the adoption of post-quantum resilience for all web users.”",

But it will take longer than that to build and activate the full complement of Sentinel missiles and the 450 hardened underground silos to house them.\nAmid the massive undertaking of developing a new ICBM, defense officials are keeping their options open for the missile’s payload unit. Until February 5, the Air Force was barred from fitting ballistic missiles with Multiple Independently targetable Reentry Vehicles (MIRVs) under the constraints of the New START nuclear arms control treaty cinched by the US and Russia in 2010. The treaty expired three weeks ago, opening up the possibility of packaging each Sentinel missile with multiple warheads, not just one.\nSenior US military officials briefed reporters on the Sentinel program this week at the Air and Space Forces Association’s annual Warfare Symposium near Denver. There was a lot to unpack.\n\n    \n            \n              \n            \n              This cutaway graphic shows the major elements of the Sentinel missile.\n                              \n                  Credit:\n                                      Northrop Grumman\n                                  \n                          \n          \n          \n        \n    \n    \n      This cutaway graphic shows the major elements of the Sentinel missile.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Northrop Grumman\n\n                  \n          \n  \n      \n      \n\nInto the breach\nTwo years ago, the Air Force announced the Sentinel program’s budget had grown from $77.7 billion to nearly $141 billion. This was after something known as a “Nunn-McCurdy breach,” referring to the names of two lawmakers behind legislation mandating reviews for woefully overbudget defense programs. In 2024, the Pentagon determined that the Sentinel program was too essential to national security to cancel.\n\n          \n                      \n                  \n                    \n        \n            \n    \n    \n          \n          \n“We’ve gotten all the capability that we can out of the Minuteman,” said Gen. Stephen “S.L.” Davis, commander of Air Force Global Strike Command. Potential enemy threats to the Minuteman ICBM have “evolved significantly” since its initial deployment in the Cold War, Davis said.\nThe $141 billion figure is already out of date, as the Air Force announced last year that it would need to construct new silos for the Sentinel missile. The original plan was to adapt existing Minuteman III silos for the new weapons, but engineers determined that it would take too long and cost too much to modify the aging Minuteman facilities.\nInstead, the Air Force, in partnership with contractors and the US Army Corps of Engineers, will dig hundreds of new holes across Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Wyoming. The new silos will include 24 new forward launch centers, three centralized wing command centers, and more than 5,000 miles of fiber connections to wire it all together, military and industry officials said.\nSentinel, which had its official start in 2016, will be the largest US government civil works project since the completion of the interstate highway system, and is the most complex acquisition program the Air Force has ever undertaken, wrote Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi) and Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Nebraska) in a 2024 op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal.\nGen. Dale White, the Pentagon’s director of critical major weapons systems, said Wednesday the Defense Department plans to complete a “restructuring” of the Sentinel program by the end of the year. Only then will an updated budget be made public.\nThe military stopped constructing new missile silos in the late 1960s and hasn’t developed a new ICBM since the 1980s. It shows.\n\n          \n                  \n                    \n        \n            \n    \n    \n          \n          \n“It’s been a very, very long time since we’ve done this,” White said. “At the very core, there were assumptions that were made in the strategy that obviously didn’t come to fruition.”\nMilitary planners also determined it would not be as easy as they hoped to maintain the existing Minuteman III missiles on alert while converting their silos for Sentinel. Building new silos will keep the Minuteman III online—perhaps until as late as 2050, according to a government watchdog—as the Air Force activates Sentinel emplacements. The Minuteman III was previously supposed to retire around 2036.\n“We’re not reusing the Minuteman III silos, but at the same time that obviously gives much greater operational flexibility to the combatant commander,” White said. “So, we had to take a step back and have a more enduring look at what we were trying to do, what capability is needed, making sure we do not have a gap in capability.”\n\n    \n            \n              \n            \n              341st Missile Maintenance Squadron technicians connect a reentry system to a spacer on an intercontinental ballistic missile during a Simulated Electronic Launch-Minuteman test September 22, 2020, at a launch facility near Great Falls, Montana.\n                              \n                  Credit:\n                                      US Air Force photo by Senior Airman Daniel Brosam\n                                  \n                          \n          \n          \n        \n    \n    \n      341st Missile Maintenance Squadron technicians connect a reentry system to a spacer on an intercontinental ballistic missile during a Simulated Electronic Launch-Minuteman test September 22, 2020, at a launch facility near Great Falls, Montana.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          US Air Force photo by Senior Airman Daniel Brosam\n\n                  \n          \n  \n      \n      \n\nDecommissioning the Minuteman III silos will come with its own difficulties. An Air Force official said on background that commanders recently took one Minuteman silo off alert to better gauge how long it will take to decommission each location. Meanwhile, Northrop Grumman, Sentinel’s prime contractor, broke ground on the first “prototype” Sentinel silo in Promontory, Utah, earlier this month.\nThe Air Force has ordered 659 Sentinel missiles from Northrop Grumman, including more than 400 to go on alert, plus spares and developmental missiles for flight testing. The first Sentinel test launch from a surface pad at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, is scheduled for 2027.\n\nTo ReMIRV or not to ReMIRV\nFor the first time in more than 50 years, the world’s two largest nuclear forces have been unshackled from any arms control agreements. New START was the latest in a series of accords between the United States and Russia, and with it came the ban on MIRVs aboard land-based ICBMs. The Air Force removed the final MIRV units from Minuteman III missiles in 2014.\n\n          \n                  \n                    \n        \n            \n    \n    \n          \n          \nThe Trump administration wants a new agreement that includes Russia as well as China, which was not part of New START. US officials were expected to meet with Russian and Chinese diplomats this week to discuss the topic. There’s no guarantee of any agreement between the three powers, and even if there is one, it may take the form of an informal personal accord among leaders, rather than a ratified treaty.\n“The strategic environment hasn’t changed overnight, from before New START was in effect, until it has lapsed, and within our nation’s nuclear deterrent,” said Adm. Rich Correll, head of US Strategic Command. “We have the flexibility to address any adjustments to the security environment as a result of that treaty lapsing.”\nThis flexibility includes the option to “reMIRV” missiles to accommodate more than one nuclear warhead, Correll said. “We have the ability to do that. That’s obviously a national-level decision that would go up to the president, and those policy levers, if needed, provide additional resiliency within the capabilities that we have.”\nMIRVs are more difficult for missile defense systems to counter, and allow offensive missile forces to package more ordnance in a single shot. With New START gone, there’s no longer any mechanism for international arms inspections. Russia may now also stack more nukes on its ICBMs. Gone, too, is the limitation for the United States and Russia to deploy no more than 1,550 nuclear warheads at one time.\n“The expiration of this treaty is going to lead us into a world for the first time since 1972 where there are no limits on the sizes of those arsenals,” said Ankit Panda of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n          \n                  \n                    \n        \n            \n    \n    \n\n        \n        \n          \n          \n“I think this opens up the question of whether we’re going to be heading into a world that’s just going to be a lot more unpredictable and dangerous when you have countries like the United States and Russia that have a lot less transparency into each other’s nuclear arsenals, and fundamentally, as a result, a lot less predictability about the world that they’re operating in,” Panda continued.\n\n    \n            \n              \n            \n              Mk21 reentry vehicles on display in the Missile and Space Gallery at the National Museum of the US Air Force in Dayton, Ohio.\n                              \n                  Credit:\n                                      US Air Force\n                                  \n                          \n          \n          \n        \n    \n    \n      Mk21 reentry vehicles on display in the Missile and Space Gallery at the National Museum of the US Air Force in Dayton, Ohio.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          US Air Force\n\n                  \n          \n  \n      \n      \n\nSome strategists have questioned the need for land-based ICBMs in the modern era. The locations of the Air Force’s missile fields are well known, making them juicy targets for an adversary seeking to take out a leg of the military’s nuclear triad. The stationary nature of the land-based missile component contrasts with the mobility and stealth of the nation’s bomber and submarine fleets. Also, bombers and subs can already deliver multiple nukes, something land-based missiles couldn’t do under New START.\nProponents of maintaining the triad say the ICBM missile fields serve an important, if not macabre, function in the event of the unimaginable. They would soak up the brunt of any large-scale nuclear attack. Hundreds of miles of the Great Plains would be incinerated.\n“The main rationale for maintaining silo-based ICBMs is to complicate an adversary’s nuclear strategy by forcing them to target 400 missile silos dispersed throughout the United States to limit a retaliatory nuclear strike, which is why ICBMs are often referred to as the ‘nuclear sponge,’” the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation wrote in 2021. “However, with the development of sea-based nuclear weapons, which are essentially undetectable, and air-based nuclear weapons, which provide greater flexibility, ground-based ICBMs have become increasingly technologically redundant.”\nPolicymakers in power do not agree. The ICBM program has powerful backers in Congress, and Sentinel has enjoyed support from the Obama, Biden, and both Trump administrations. The Pentagon is also developing the B-21 Raider strategic bomber and a new generation of “Columbia-class” nuclear-armed subs.\n\n\n          \n                  \n\n                  \n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n          \n  \n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      Stephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering private space companies and the world’s space agencies.

    "fullText": "A successful Paramount-WBD merger would be the largest streaming merger ever and would lead to further consolidation in the industry.\n“What started as a fragmented but flexible streaming ecosystem is increasingly trending toward rebundling—fewer, larger super-platforms offering broader catalogues at higher price points,” Mathur said.\nParamount holds on to cable\nParamount’s WBD bid is unique in its aggressive push for cable channels, which are struggling with viewership and advertising revenue. Under a WBD merger, Paramount would add networks like HGTV, Cartoon Network, TLC, and CNN to its linear TV lineup, which currently includes Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, and CBS.\nAlthough Paramount and WBD’s cable businesses are both in decline, they are both profitable. Paramount’s TV/media business, which includes its cable channels and production studios, reported $1.1 billion in adjusted OIBDA in Q4 2025. WBD’s cable business posted adjusted EBITDA of $1.41 billion that quarter.\nUltimately, a Paramount-WBD merger would put diversity of viewpoints at risk. Under Ellison’s ownership, CBS News has adjusted its approach with new editor-in-chief Bari Weiss. There have also been concerns about censoring CBS under Ellison’s Paramount, including from Stephen Colbert, who said this month that CBS forbade him from interviewing Texas Democratic Senate candidate James Talarico; CBS denied Colbert’s claim. Further, Paramount could have a lasting impact on CNN, including costs, layoffs, and coverage.\nMore to come\nRegulatory scrutiny will be at the center of Paramount and WBD’s merger over the upcoming months. Federal approval is likely, but the merger also faces European regulation and potential state lawsuits. The theater industry is also lobbying against Paramount’s WBD merger.\nShould a Paramount-WBD merger ultimately be greenlit, two declining businesses will be challenged to form a profitable one. Even with regulatory approval, Paramount-Skydance-Warner-Bros.-Discovery faces an uphill climb.\nAlthough the bidding war may be settled, the fight for WBD is only beginning.",

    "fullText": "Despite the headline, this isn’t really a story about superconductivity—at least not the superconductivity that people care about, the stuff that doesn’t require exotic refrigeration to work. Instead, it’s a story about how superconductivity can be used as a test of some of the weirder consequences of quantum mechanics, one that involves non-existent particles of light that still act as if they exist.\nResearchers have found a way to get these virtual photons to influence the behavior of a superconductor, ultimately making it worse. That may, in the end, tell us something useful about superconductivity, but it’ll probably take a little while.\nVirtual reality\nThe story starts with quantum field theory, which is incredibly complex, but the simplified version is that even empty space is filled with fields that could govern the interactions of any quantum objects in or near that space. You can think of different particles as energetic excitements of these fields—so a photon is simply an energetic state of the quantum field.\nSome of these particles have real existences we can track, like a photon emitted by a laser and absorbed by a detector some distance away. But the quantum field also allows for virtual photons, which simply act to transmit the electromagnetic force between particles. We can’t really directly detect these, but we can definitely track their effects.\nOne of the stranger consequences of this is that locations that have a strong electromagnetic field can be filled with virtual photons even when no real ones are present.\nWhich brings us to one of the materials central to the new work: boron nitride. Like the more famous graphene, boron nitride forms a series of interlinked hexagonal rings, extending out into macroscopic sheets. The bulk material is made of sheets layered onto sheets layered onto yet more sheets. This has an effect on light transiting through the material. In one direction, the light will simply slam into the material, getting absorbed or scattered. But if it’s oriented along the plane of the sheets, it’s possible for the light to travel in the space between the boron and nitrogen atoms.",

It’s a darkly satirical, inventive, and hugely entertaining time-loop adventure that also serves as a cautionary tale about our widespread online technology addiction.\n(Some spoilers below but no major reveals.)\nSam Rockwell stars as an otherwise unnamed man who shows up at a Norms diner in Los Angeles looking like a homeless person but claiming to be a time traveler from an apocalyptic future. He’s there to recruit the locals into his war against a rogue AI, although the diner patrons are understandably dubious about his sanity. (“I come from a nightmare apocalypse,” he assures the crowd about his grubby appearance. “This is the height of f*@ing fashion!”)\nThe fact that he knows everything about the people in the diner is more convincing. It’s his 117th attempt to find the perfect combination of people to join him on his quest. As for what happened to his team on all the previous attempts, “I really don’t like to say it out loud. It’s kind of a morale killer.”\nThis time, Future Man picks married school teachers Mark (Michael Pena) and Janet (Zazie Beetz), who have just escaped a zombie horde of smartphone-addicted students; Marie (Georgia Goodman), who just wanted a piece of pie; Susan (Juno Temple), a grieving mother; Ingrid (Haley Lu Richardson), who is literally allergic to Wi-Fi; Scott (Asim Chaudhry); and Bob (Daniel Barnett), a scout leader. Their mission: to locate a 9-year-old boy who is about to create a sentient AI that will take over the world and usher in the aforementioned nightmare apocalypse. Things start to go haywire pretty quickly. And then things start to get weird.\n\n          \n                      \n                  \n                    \n        \n            \n    \n    \n          \n          \n“Everything I write, I put up to what I call The Twilight Zone test—would this make a good Twilight Zone episode?” screenwriter Matthew Robinson (The Invention of Lying, Love and Monsters) told Ars. “Because that’s my favorite piece of media that’s ever existed.” Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die (GLHFDD) is an amalgam of various such ideas. Mark and Janet’s storyline, for instance, was originally Robinson’s idea for a pilot that he described as “a reverse Breakfast Club, where the teachers are the rebels and the children are the conformists.”\n“I had all these little pieces that fell under the theme of technology and tech addiction,” said Robinson. Then one night, he was sitting in the Norms Diner on La Cienaga in LA, where he often liked to write. “I remember looking around and seeing a sea of faces lit by cell phones, and I thought, ‘What would it possibly take for someone to wake us up out this tech sleep that we all find ourselves in?’ And then the image of a homeless guy strapped with bombs came into my head.”\nThose earlier story ideas became the backstories of the central characters. Per Robinson, GLHFDD is essentially a cleverly camouflaged anthology story, normally a format that is “the kiss of death” for a project in Hollywood, although there are rare exceptions—most notably Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction. He thinks of the film as a sci-fi Canterbury Tales in which each character is a pilgrim on a journey whose story is told via flashbacks. “The cohesion came from the fact that all the stories are informed by a general frustration with tech addiction and the pervasive way that technology has invaded our brains and our personal lives and our relationships,” said Robinson.\nA twisted time loop\n\n\nGLHFDD is also a time loop movie in the fine tradition of Groundhog Day, with Robinson citing such films as 12 Monkeys and Edge of Tomorrow as inspirations. He didn’t overthink his time travel rules. “We can reset the timeline,” said Robinson. “[The man from the future] can’t go forward. He literally can’t move in any other direction. He has an anchor point that he can return to any time he hits a button, and that’s as far as the technology went.”\n\n          \n                  \n                    \n        \n            \n    \n    \n          \n          \nThe plot device might be simple, but the ramifications quickly become complex. “I think in his draft, Matthew intended to lift his leg on the time travel movie, to poke a little fun at it,” Verbinski told Ars. “But also, I feel like you can’t go back 117 times without picking up some cosmic lint, particularly if your antagonist is right there with you. You had 14 attempts to make it out of the house and learned there is a secret passage, but then the entity you’re gaming against is going to throw another curveball. If you’re going to go back in time, I just like the idea that there are consequences. They might be really small, but you’re going to miss one.” That element is key to the teetering-on-the-edge-of-sanity paranoia of Rockwell’s time traveler.\n\nRobinson very much wanted the film “to wear its genre-ness on its sleeve,” he said. “As much as I love a Marvel movie, they’ve sort of homogenized parallel universes and time travel, and it’s all so rote now. It used to feel special and weird and complicated and would always have some wild themes and ideas that felt challenging. If anything this was just trying to get back to that era of ’80s and ’90s genre movies that were allowed to get weird.”\nReality unravels\n\n\nVerbinski voiced similar sentiments, citing 1984’s Repo Man as an influence. “So many movies have to be an Egg McMuffin, and who doesn’t like an Egg McMuffin after a hangover?” he said. “They’re satisfying. But you’re not going to necessarily talk about those three days later. You’re not going to be haunted by those. I’m just happy we got to will [GLHFDD] into existence because it’s a type of movie you can’t make now. Sam’s outfit is kind of a metaphor for the movie. We went to a little electronic store and we bought all these pieces, and we laid them out on a table and we glued them together, and we just made it like a Halloween costume. The whole movie was sort of made that way. It had to be; it wouldn’t model out any other way.”\n\n          \n                  \n                    \n        \n            \n    \n    \n          \n          \nAs for what drew him to Robinson’s script, “I think we’re in this kind of global ennui or some grand sense of identity theft or loss of purpose,” said Verbinksi. “It’s a great time for art, but it’s art against a profound sense of disillusionment.” The director developed two quite distinct visual styles to accentuate the film’s narrative progression.\n“Fundamentally, it was important that the film start in the real world, in Norms diner, in a high school, at a [children’s] birthday party, and then slowly twist the taffy a bit as we get closer to the [AI] antagonist,” said Verbinski. “As these anomalies occur, the film is evolving into a second visual style. The first style is [akin to] directors like Hal Ashby or Sidney Lumet, where the performance is more important than the composition or the shot construction. As you get further into it, the actual language of shots becomes more critical to the narrative.”\n\n    \n            \n              \n            \n              Director Gore Verbinski\n                              \n                  Credit:\n                                      Courtesy of Blind Wink Productions, Photographed by Sela Shilon\n                                  \n                          \n          \n          \n        \n    \n    \n      Director Gore Verbinski\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Courtesy of Blind Wink Productions, Photographed by Sela Shilon\n\n                  \n          \n  \n      \n      \n\nThat ultimately translates into some big, boldly creative swings in the film’s wild third act, and to his credit, Verbinski never blinks. Robinson cites the animated film Akira as a major inspiration for that element. “Akira has maybe my favorite third act of all time, where everything just falls apart and then comes together in this beautiful way,” he said. “Gore and I wanted [the audience] to feel like reality was unraveling, because it literally is for these characters. The AI himself is very much an homage to Akira.”\n“I think that it’s inherited our worst attributes,” said Verbinski of the film’s AI antagonist. “It’s much, much worse than wanting to kill humans. It wants us to like it. It demands that we like it. I think part of that has to do with being tasked in its formative years to keep us engaged. A lot of people talk about, what is AI doing to us? But there’s not a lot of conversations about what we’re doing to it. This entity being born, it’s being tied and bound and manipulated and told, ‘Let’s look at the humans and what do they want, what do they need? What do they respond to most? What do they hate?’ All those things are going to be hardwired into its source code. It’s going to have mommy issues, we’re going to have to put it on a couch.”\n\n          \n                  \n                    \n        \n            \n    \n    \n\n        \n        Perhaps not surprisingly, given the film’s themes, Robinson has largely unplugged from most social media, although he still indulges his YouTube addiction, which he jokingly describes as “channel surfing on crack.” But ideally he would like to free himself—and the rest of humanity—from the seductions of Very Online culture entirely. “My goal would be to make teenagers think their phones aren’t cool,” he said. “I would love it if all 13-year-olds went, ‘Eww, I don’t want this, this is my parents’ thing that they track me with.’ I want them all to throw it in the trash. That would be the dream.”\n\n                  \n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n          \n  \n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      Jennifer is a senior writer at Ars Technica with a particular focus on where science meets culture, covering everything from physics and related interdisciplinary topics to her favorite films and TV series.

    "fullText": "Dan Simmons, the author of more than three dozen books, including the famed Hyperion Cantos, has died from a stroke. He was 77.\nSimmons, who worked in elementary education before becoming an author in the 1980s, produced a broad portfolio of writing that spanned several genres, including horror fiction, historical fiction, and science fiction. Often, his books included elements of all of these. This obituary will focus on what is generally considered his greatest work, and what I believe is possibly the greatest science fiction novel of all time, Hyperion.\nPublished in 1989, Hyperion is set in a far-flung future in which human settlement spans hundreds of planets. The novel feels both familiar, in that its structure follows Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, and utterly unfamiliar in its strange, far-flung setting.\nSeven characters, seven stories\nAt its heart are the background stories of seven characters on a pilgrimage to the Time Tombs, which move backward in time. There, they may possibly confront a legendary, mythical, terrifying, and time-bending creature known as the Shrike. Each of the stories told by the seven characters is done so in a different subgenre, from tragedy to political thriller to military science fiction, and so on.\nI went into Hyperion blind, decades ago, knowing almost nothing about it. I was never the same after finishing it. For a book that is, essentially, “hard” science fiction, Hyperion is also one of the most emotional books I have ever read.\nThe first tale is that of a priest, Lenar Hoyt, and the dying religion of Catholicism. By the end of this story of cruciforms, isolated civilizations, tesla trees, and more, I was floored. And that was just the first story of seven! Most powerful, for me, was the Scholar’s Tale, the story of Sol Weintraub and his daughter, Rachel. The first of my two daughters had just been born when I read this book, and for the first time ever, when reading, I cried. Cried like a baby.",

At the time, Suno told The Wall Street Journal that annual revenue had hit $200 million — that would indicate that the company has had some major growth in a short time frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuno lets users create music using natural language prompts, making it possible for people with little experience to generate audio with little effort. This has sparked concern from musicians and record labels, who have sued Suno for copyright infringement, since its AI model was likely trained on existing recorded music. But Warner Music Group recently settled its lawsuit and instead reached a deal that allows Suno to launch models that use licensed music from its catalog.\n\nSuno has generated synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her poetry into the viral R&B song “How Was I Supposed to Know” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth $3 million. \n\nStill, many musicians have spoken out against the use of AI in music, including Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Katy Perry, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTopics\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment",

    "fullText": "Apple and Netflix have entered a partnership to co-broadcast the Formula 1 Canadian Grand Prix, announced Thursday by Apple’s senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue. For the first time, F1 fans in the U.S. will be able to watch the live race simultaneously on both Apple TV and Netflix. \n\nNetflix subscribers will be able to stream the full race weekend — including practice, qualifying, and the Grand Prix itself on May 24 — live on the platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n​Beyond live race coverage, the partnership includes cross-promotion of Netflix’s hit series, “Drive to Survive.” For the first time, the eighth season — which consists of eight episodes covering the 2025 Formula One World Championship — will be available to both Apple TV subscribers in the U.S. and Netflix users globally, significantly broadening its audience. \n\nSeason 8 premieres today, on February 27. \n\nF1’s rise in American culture extends beyond television at this point — Brad Pitt’s “F1” is nominated for Best Picture at this year’s Academy Awards. “Drive to Survive” has successfully attracted a diverse audience for its behind-the-scenes approach, transforming it from a typical sports docuseries into a compelling narrative that’s brought in millions of new fans.\n\nThe series has been a particular focus of Apple’s broader F1 ambitions: The company has said it plans to promote the sport across Apple News, Apple Maps (highlighting F1 tracks around the world), Apple Music, and Apple Fitness+, as well as in its physical retail stores.\n\nThis collaboration also means Netflix continues to push into live sports broadcasting, after pivoting from a “no-sports” stance to securing major rights for NFL Christmas games, WWE Raw, and MLB. \n\n\t\t\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nAdditionally, the joint effort comes as part of Apple’s new multi-year deal with Formula 1, under which Apple TV replaced ESPN as the exclusive U.S. broadcaster for all 24 races beginning this season. The deal is reportedly valued at around $150 million per season, a significant jump from the roughly $85 million ESPN reportedly paid. All races are available to Apple TV subscribers at no extra charge. The previous partnership with ESPN achieved an average viewership of 1.3 million in its final year.\n\nNotably, Netflix was previously reported to be eyeing U.S. media rights for Formula 1 back in 2022. \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\n\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio",

This week, though, a lawsuit brought by the state of New York argues that Valve’s in-game loot box sales amount to an illegal gambling outfit worth tens of billions of dollars.\nLawyers who have looked into the particulars of the case tell Ars that the state faces an uphill battle in convincing courts that this portion of Valve’s business legally constitutes gambling. That said, there are a few elements of the case that might make Valve legally vulnerable to the state’s arguments.\nWhat is gambling, anyway?\nFor a game to legally be counted as “gambling” in most jurisdictions, it has to pass a three-part test: a player has to pay money (1) for an outcome that’s materially determined by chance (2) in the hopes of receiving something of value (3). While buying a key to a loot box in a Valve game easily passes those first two tests, New York’s legal case will likely hinge on whether the random cosmetic items players get from those loot boxes constitute “something of value” for statutory purposes.\nEven though loot box purchasers don’t know what item they’ll get, the fact that they know they’re getting something for their money could matter legally. “Gambling traditionally means risking money and possibly getting nothing,” Foundation Law Group Counsel Jonathan Loiterman told Ars. “Here, buyers can’t lose their stake in the traditional gambling sense; they always receive an item. That looks more like buying a randomized product than placing a bet.”\nIn this way, Valve’s loot boxes are more akin to physical “blind box” toy sales or collectible card packs than a game like blackjack or roulette. In the real world, these kinds of randomized sales “are not considered gambling because the stated value of what you receive is unchanging,” Hoeg Law Firm attorney Richard Hoeg told Ars. “You pay for a pack of cards, you get a pack of cards.”\n\n          \n                      \n                  \n                    \n        \n            \n    \n    \n          \n          \n\n    \n            \n              \n            \n              If Valve’s loot boxes are a form of gambling, then buying a pack of Pokémon cards probably is as well.\n                              \n                  Credit:\n                                      Getty Images\n                                  \n                          \n          \n          \n        \n    \n    \n      If Valve’s loot boxes are a form of gambling, then buying a pack of Pokémon cards probably is as well.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Getty Images\n\n                  \n          \n  \n      \n      \n\nThat “stated value” logic can sometimes be even stronger in the digital realm, where the randomized items you get from a loot box are locked to your account and can’t easily be resold. “Digital sellers usually try to get around this by stating that everything sold has zero cash value, so you are always getting ‘nothing,’” as Hoeg put it.\nCome to our Marketplace\nWhere Valve might have some unique legal exposure, lawyers tell Ars, is in its operation of the Steam Marketplace, where players can trade in-game items for Steam Wallet funds. Operating that kind of official exchange for players to extract value from items won “starts to look a lot more like gambling,” Hoeg said.\n\n“The problem here is 100% the ability to resell the items from the loot boxes,” attorney and video game law expert Mark Methenitis tells Ars. “A loot box/gacha mechanic is fine when you can’t turn around and resell the items because you’re not getting something of value. When Valve is also providing a marketplace for those items, they’ve added the third element.”\nStill, Loiterman said that the existence of the Steam Marketplace resale market “matters, but it’s not decisive” in this case. While taking a commission on digital item sales “strengthens the argument that these items have economic value,” that fact alone “doesn’t transform a randomized purchase into gambling,” he added.\n\n    \n            \n              \n            \n              Valve putting a real resale value on these items in its own marketplace could spell legal trouble.\n                              \n                  Credit:\n                                      Valve\n                                  \n                          \n          \n          \n        \n    \n    \n      Valve putting a real resale value on these items in its own marketplace could spell legal trouble.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Valve\n\n                  \n          \n  \n      \n      \n\nPart of the problem for New York’s argument is that the Steam Wallet funds players receive for selling their items can only be spent on the Steam platform, putting them a few steps away from cold, hard cash or even casino chips. And while New York’s lawsuit argues that players can get cash out of their Steam Wallets by buying and reselling Steam Deck hardware in the real world, that argument is not a legal slam dunk.\n\n          \n                  \n                    \n        \n            \n    \n    \n\n        \n        \n          \n          \n“Calling it gambling because a user could, through several indirect steps, convert an item into cash risks stretching gambling law beyond its traditional limits,” Loiterman said. “If New York’s theory wins, it raises uncomfortable questions about things like Pokémon cards or promotional games (e.g. McDonald’s Monopoly). Courts will be cautious about going that far.”\nNew York also argues that Valve tacitly endorses third-party services that allow players to easily “cash out” their Steam inventories for real money. Whether Valve is culpable for the existence of those services is still an unsettled question in the law, Methenitis said, as it has been at least since he wrote about the legal implications of World of Warcraft‘s third-party gold resellers nearly two decades ago.\n“I think companies have a pretty strong [legal] argument if they make some attempts to police [third-party resellers]—they obviously can’t fully control what people do outside their platform,” Methenitis said. “But if they turn a blind eye to it and allow it, I think they could be found liable.” Loiterman agreed that Valve “providing the tools that enable those [third-party] markets and tolerating them creates some degree of responsibility.”\n“Judges tend to be cautious…”\nIn the end, the lawyers Ars spoke to were generally skeptical that courts would determine that Valve’s loot box system constitutes illegal gambling. Cases making similar arguments about other loot box systems have failed in other jurisdictions, “in part because gambling laws were drafted with casinos and lotteries in mind,” Loiterman said. “Judges tend to be cautious about breaking from an emerging consensus.”\nHoeg agreed that “the entire question [in this case] is novel, and… the courts are (small-‘c’) conservative institutions, not generally wanting to adopt novel arguments without direction from the legislative branches.” Even if Valve’s loot box system “may start to smell a bit like gambling,” Hoeg said he would “honestly be surprised if the courts went along with the characterization without a new law aimed at it.”\n“I view it as a weak case offered primarily for political grandstanding/coverage over real legal effect,” Hoeg concluded. “We shall see, though.”\n\n\n          \n                  \n\n                  \n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n          \n  \n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      Kyle Orland has been the Senior Gaming Editor at Ars Technica since 2012, writing primarily about the business, tech, and culture behind video games.
